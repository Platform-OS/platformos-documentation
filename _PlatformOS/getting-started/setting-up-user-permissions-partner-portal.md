This guide will help you give permissions to Users of the Partner Portal. Permissions include having read, write, or write and deploy access to different Partners, and being allowed to create new Partners. 

## Requirements
To be able to set up permissions for Users on the Partner Portal, you have to have access to our Partner Portal, and the Users you would like to give permissions to. 

* [Accessing Our Partner Portal]()
* [Inviting a New User to the Partner Portal]()

## Steps 

Setting up User permissions is a two-step process:

1.   Grant permission to create new Partner
2.   Grant permissions to access Partners 

### Step 1: Grant permission to create new Partner

Log in to our [Partner Portal](https://portal.apps.near-me.com). In the [list of Partners](https://portal.apps.near-me.com/partners), locate the Partner the User belongs to, and click on `Users`. To select the User, click on its email address.   

On the User's information page, click on `Manage permissions`. If the User doesn't have permission to create new Partners, you can grant permission by clicking on `Grant` under `Grant permission to create new Partners`. 

If the User has permission to create new Partners, you can revoke this permission, by clicking on `Revoke` under `Revoke permission to create new Partners`. 

### Step 2: Grant permissions to access Partners and the Partner Portal

To grant permissions to access Partners, select the Partners you would like to give the User access to by checking their checkboxes. 

Select access level (`Read`, `Write` or `Write and deploy`) to the Partner Portal:
* `Read`: The user can see everything on the Partner Portal, but can't modify anything. 
* `Write`: The user can see and modify anything on the Partner Portal, but can't deploy (`marketplace-kit deploy` command). E.g. non-developer, who needs to set up payment gateways. 
* `Write and deploy`: The user can see, and modify anything on the Partner Portal, and has the permission to deploy. E.g. developer. 

Once you've selected the permissions, click on `Submit`. 

You can check the User's permissions anytime under `This user has access to following partners` on the User's information page. 

## Next steps
Congratulations! You have set up User permissions on our Partner Portal. Now, you may want to set up a site on our platform.
