Takes a string as an argument and returns a string representing the URL to this asset served by our CDN.

## Example 1: file found


```liquid
{% raw %}
{{ 'images/logo.svg' | asset_url }}
{% endraw %}
```


It will return absolute url to the asset: `<CDN URL>/instances/123/assets/images/logo.svg?uploaded=xxxxxxx`

{% include 'alert/note', content: 'We add a timestamp as a query parameter to the filename.
This timestamp is regenerated every time the file content has changed and uploaded to your storage.
When accessing the file, you don&apos;t have to add it, you can just as well request the file without the `uploaded` parameter.
If you add the `uploaded` parameter, the CDN is guaranteed to serve the most current file uploaded to your storage.' %}

You can nest assets in any number of directories.

In the example above the file `images/logo.svg` would be placed in `assets/images/logo.svg`.

## Example 2: file not found


```liquid
{% raw %}
{{ 'fonts/missing.woff' | asset_url }}
{% endraw %}
```


It will return the root directory of the CDN: `<CDN URL>/instances/123/assets/`
