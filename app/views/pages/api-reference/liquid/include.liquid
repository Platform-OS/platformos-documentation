The `include` tag allows you to make your code more maintainable by including templates within other templates.

The simplest example of `include` looks like this:

##### app/views/pages/include.liquid

```liquid
{% raw %}
---
slug: include
---
{% include 'mypartial' %}
<br/>
{% include 'mypartial2' %}
{% endraw %}
```

##### app/views/partials/mypartial.liquid

```liquid
This is first partial
```

##### app/views/partials/mypartial2.liquid

```liquid
This is second partial
```

After expanding `include`, it becomes:

```liquid
---
slug: include
---
This is first partial
<br/>
This is second partial
```

You can include the same partial multiple times in multiple places for code reuse.

## Local variable using `with`

Liquid has some issues when you try to use a variable that is named exactly the same as the partial.
For example, for the `product.liquid` file, you would name the variable `product`.
`include` has a method to deal with this issue, at least when you pass data to the partial.

Anything after the `with` keyword will be assigned to a variable that is called the same as this partial.

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% parse_json cars %}
[{
  "maker": "Honda",
  "model": "CRX"
}]
{% endparse_json %}
{% include 'product' with cars[0] %}
{% endraw %}
```

Partial:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{{ product }}
{% endraw %}
```

This will create the variable called `product` with hash inside of it.

```json
{"maker"=>"Honda", "model"=>"CRX"}
```

The properties of hash are accessible using the `object["key"]` syntax, for example:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{{ product["maker"] }} => Honda
{% endraw %}
```

## Iterating over a collection using `for`

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% parse_json cars %}
[{
  "maker": "Honda",
  "model": "CRX"
}, {
  "maker": "Subaru",
  "model": "Forester"
}, {
  "maker": "Lexus",
  "model": "LFA"
}]
{% endparse_json %}

{% include 'product' for cars %}
{% endraw %}
```

This will iterate over the collection and render the partial for each item. Each iteration will have the `product` variable populated with the current item.

Having a partial that looks like this:

##### app/views/partials/product.liquid

```liquid
{% raw %}
{{ product }}
{% endraw %}
```

Will render (whitespace has been changed for readability):

```liquid
{"maker"=>"Honda", "model"=>"CRX"}
{"maker"=>"Subaru", "model"=>"Forester"}
{"maker"=>"Lexus", "model"=>"LFA"}
```

## Private variables and exporting them

Our Liquid implementation is 99% compatible with the official one, but we couldn't ignore the issue that you can only use global variables in Liquid.

In platformOS, when you define a variable in a partial, it is not visible by default in a page that is including that partial.

It works from top to bottom though: If you define a variable on a page and then include it in a partial, it will be accessible in the partial.

That means that given this partial:

##### app/views/partials/variable.liquid

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% assign my_car = "Honda" %}
{% endraw %}
```

And this page using it:

##### app/views/pages/include.liquid

```liquid
{% raw %}
---
slug: include
---
{% include 'variable' %}
This is empty: {{ my_car }}
{% endraw %}
```

Will not return `Honda` in the page. The `my_car` variable can be accessed only inside the `variable` partial.

To use a variable that has been defined inside a partial, outside of it, you need to use the [export](/api-reference/liquid/platformos-tags#export) tag and [context.exports](/developer-guide/variables/context-variable#exposing-a-local-variable-within-the-context-object).

##### app/views/partials/export.liquid

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% parse_json honda %}
{
  "maker": "Honda",
  "model": "CRX",
  "year": "1991"
}
{% endparse_json %}
{% export honda, namespace: "my_car" %}
{% endraw %}
```

##### app/views/pages/include.liquid

```liquid
{% raw %}
---
slug: include
---
{% include 'export' %}
Car: {{ context.exports.my_car }}
My car maker: {{ context.exports.my_car.honda.maker }}
{% endraw %}
```

This should render the stringified hash stored inside the variable in the first line, and nested key in the second:

```json
Car: {"honda"=>{"maker"=>"Honda", "model"=>"CRX", "year"=>"1991"}}
My car maker: Honda
```
