This best practice explains how platformOS prevents the indexing of non-production sites to avoid the website being flagged as duplicated content. 

SEO helps you get more organic traffic to your website, and one of the most important aspects is to have good, original content. Having duplicated content is treated as a disadvantage in the eyes of search engines.

platformOS adds the proper `x-robots-tag` to:

* all staging Instances, because they are used for testing
* production Instances that have no custom domain added, because usually they are temporary Instances while a migration or tests are in progress

```shell
$ curl -I https://documentation-staging.staging.oregon.platform-os.com

HTTP/2 200
...
x-robots-tag: noindex, nofollow
```

`noindex, nofollow` prevents robots from indexing the page altogether, hence not flagging it as duplicated content, until you are ready with your production domain.
