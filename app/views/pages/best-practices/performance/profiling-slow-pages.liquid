This guide will show you how to profile a slow page to find performance issues.

## Requirements

This is an advanced tutorial. To follow it, you should be familiar with basic platformOS concepts, Liquid, the topics in the Get Started section, and tutorials related to Pages.

* [How platformOS Works](/how-platformos-works)
* [Get Started](/get-started)
* [Pages tutorials](/tutorials/pages/pages)

## Steps

Profiling a page is a two-step process:

<div data-autosteps></div>

### Step 1: Enable profiling for a page

Add `enable_profiler: true` to a YML file corresponding to the page you want to profile:

```yaml
---
slug: my-slow-page
enable_profiler: true
---
```
```liquid
{% raw %}
{% include 'very_time_consuming_partial' %}
{% endraw %}
```

{% include 'alert/warning', content: 'To avoid noise, the log will include only entries which took longer than 10ms.' %}

### Step 2: View results

When the flag is set, whenever you trigger a request to the `my-slow-page`, two log entries will be added and accessible via the `pos-cli logs` command.
The first one shows information about the page, the second one about the layout associated with the page. You can use this information to identify slow code and improve it.

See an example result for one of our documentation pages:

#### How to interpret the results

At the very top (Level 0) you can see `TOTAL` measured in seconds. In this case it is 0.35 seconds.

Each entry is showing the percentage of time that it took to complete a particular operation.

Inspect each level completion time by looking at percentages from left to right.
The most time consuming Level 2 was the third one, so this is where you would look for bottlenecks first.

Going to the most nested level, in this case 7, you can see that 41% of the total rendering time was spent on fetching GitHub contributors. This is something to look at if your page is slow.

{% include 'alert/warning', content: 'Try not to profile a page on production, as it can result in a performance hit. If you absolutely have to, make sure to disable it right after you trigger the request to the page, to minimize the risk of leaving profiling enabled for a long period of time.' %}
