---

This guide will help you create your own logs using the `log` Liquid tag. This tag allows you to print any information to application logs as type info, debug, error, or your own type, and list them in your console next to your sync.

You can use the `log` tag in any file that accepts Liquid, so you can use them in pages, layouts, partials, Authorization Policies, async callbacks, etc.

## Requirements
So that you can follow the steps in this tutorial, you have to have the pos-cli installed, an environment configured, and the codebase set up. You should be familiar with Pages, and the technologies behind platformOS, especially Liquid.

* [Get Started](/get-started): helps you get access to our platform, set up a site, install the pos-cli, set up the required directory structure, and deploy to your site.
* [Technologies](/developer-guide/about-platform-os#technologies)

## Steps

Creating your own application logs is a two-step process:

<div data-autosteps></div>

### Step 1: Use `log` Liquid tag
Create a page using the `log` Liquid tag, and sync it.

```liquid
{% raw %}
---
slug: log-test
---
{% log 'This is a message' %}
{% log params, type: 'request-params' %}
{% log user.id, type: 'debug' %}
{% endraw %}
```

#### Notes:
You can print any object to the logs that can be printed.
You can use parameters (e.g. take parameters from the URL and include them in the message).
The `type` of the log entry can be any string you want to tag your entry.
If you chose `error` pos-cli will mark it red and try to notify your OS.

### Step 2: Start logging
In your command line, enter the command to start live logging:

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
pos-cli logs staging
</code></pre>

This pulls the logs from the server every couple of seconds and displays them in your command line.
