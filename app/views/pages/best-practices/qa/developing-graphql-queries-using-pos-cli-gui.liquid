This guide will help you quickly develop GraphQL queries using the `pos-cli gui serve` command.

`pos-cli gui serve` command is very useful when:

1) You are developing a new query and you want to be sure it is working - it communicates with the database directly, so you are eliminating errors stemming from other layers and features of the system.

2) You are debugging an error - because you have direct control over a query and instant feedback after your changes, you can strip everything that you don't need, manipulate arguments passed, etc.

## Requirements
So that you can follow the steps in this tutorial, you have to have the pos-cli installed, an environment configured, and the codebase set up. You should be familiar with Pages, and the technologies behind platformOS, especially Liquid.

* [Quickstart Guide](/get-started/quickstart-guide) or [Get Started tutorials](/get-started): help you get access to our platform, set up a site, install the pos-cli, set up the required directory structure, and deploy to your site.
* [Technologies](/how-platformos-works/technologies)

## Steps

Developing GraphQL queries using pos-cli gui is a two-step process:

<div data-autosteps></div>

### Step 1: Start pos-cli gui serve

<pre class="command-line" data-output="2-4" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
pos-cli gui serve staging
Server is listening on 3333
Resources Editor: http://localhost:3333/gui/editor
GraphQL Browser: http://localhost:3333/gui/graphql
</code></pre>

{% include "alert/note", content: "Replace `staging` with the environment name you want to develop on. To list all available environments use `pos-cli env list`" %}

### Step 2: Write / update query

To write your query go to the second link: [http://localhost:3333/gui/graphql](http://localhost:3333/gui/graphql)

You will be greeted with [graphiql editor](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql).

#### Tips

* On the right side, you can open sidebar with graphql schema documentation.
* When you don't know what to type, try pressing `ctrl + space` - this will open the suggestion box and usually help you decide.
* To quickly run the query, press `ctrl + enter` (or `cmd + enter` on a Mac).
* To pass arguments to a query, open `Query variables` panel on the bottom and write them in JSON format (see image above)
