  title: Resetting token
  description: This guide will help you reset leaked user or instance token on the Partner Portal.
---

Sometimes tokens get leaked by accidental copy & paste into slack, or by commiting `.pos` file into version control. Fortunately we have taken steps to minimize impact of that after that happens:

1. Tokens are per-instance, per-user. Meaning if you leak your token for one environment, whoever finds it, will be able to only impact this one environment.
2. Tokens can be quickly deleted/turned off on an environment basis in Partner Portal

## How to delete my token

1. Go to your [account settings in Partner Portal](https://partners.platformos.com/me/) at https://partners.platformos.com/me/
2. Click button "Tokens"
3. Find your instance name on the list of all your tokens
4. Click "Delete" button on the right of it

## How to generate new token

To generate new token you need to add environment again in the same way as you did for the first time:

```
pos-cli env add --email <your email> --url <url> <enviornment>
```

If you name your environment the same as before, it will be overwritten with new token.

Read more about [using pos-cli](https://documentation.platformos.com/get-started/marketplace-template/marketplace-template#step-3-add-instance-to-pos-cli).


## Legacy tokens

Before August 19, 2020 tokens were global, so resetting your token will turn off this token for all your environments. After August 19, 2020 environments added using pos-cli are scoped to only this one environment, so it is enough to just delete token for that one environment and re-add it again.

### How to know if my token is current or legacy?

* Currently tokens consists of small letter, big letter, numbers, underscore (_), dashes (-) and are 43 characters long.
* Legacy tokens contains only small letters and numbers and are 40 characters long.
