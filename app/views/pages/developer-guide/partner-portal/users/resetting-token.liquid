  title: Resetting a Token
  description: This guide will help you reset a leaked user or Instance token on the Partner Portal.
---

Sometimes tokens get leaked by accidental copy & paste into Slack, or by commiting the `.pos` file into version control. We have taken steps to minimize the impact of leaked tokens through the following:

1. Tokens are per-instance, per-user. Meaning if you leak your token for one environment, whoever finds it will only be able to impact this one environment.
2. Tokens can be quickly deleted/turned off on an environment basis in the Partner Portal. 

## How to delete my token

1. Go to your [account settings in Partner Portal](https://partners.platformos.com/me/) at https://partners.platformos.com/me/
2. Click the "Tokens" button 
3. Find your Instance name on the list of all your tokens
4. Click the "Delete" button associated with the Instance

## How to generate a new token

To generate a new token, you need to add the environment again in the same way as you did for the first time:

```
pos-cli env add --email <your email> --url <url> <enviornment>
```

If you name your environment the same as before, it will be overwritten with the new token.

Read more about [using the pos-cli](https://documentation.platformos.com/get-started/marketplace-template/marketplace-template#step-3-add-instance-to-pos-cli).


## Legacy tokens

Before August 19, 2020 tokens were global, so resetting your token will turn off this token for all your environments. After August 19, 2020 environments added using pos-cli are scoped to only this one environment, so it is enough to delete the token for that one environment and re-add it.

### How to know if my token is current or legacy?

* Currently tokens consist of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, underscore (_), dashes (-) and are 43 characters long.
* Legacy tokens contain only lowercase letters and numbers and are 40 characters long.
