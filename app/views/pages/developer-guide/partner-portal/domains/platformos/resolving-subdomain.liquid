This guide provides an overview of how to set up a custom domain on a Production Instance using platformOS's DNS web service, as well as create and provision an AWS SSL certificate for your Instance.

## platformOS DNS and resolving to subdomain (example: https://marketplace.example.com)

1. Go to the Instance detail page in the platformOS Partner Portal: https://partners.platformos.com
2. Click `Domains`.
3. Click `Add new domain to your Instance`.
4. Click `DNS Zone`.
5. Add your subdomain name (do not add www), check the box if this will be your default domain, and finally click `Create DNS Zone`.
6. From the Domains page, you'll want to refresh the page every few minutes until the status of the new domain changes to `reparking_domain`. Once it does, click `v

### When you are ready to "Go Live", please continue.

7. In your root domains DNS records, add a nameserver record for the subdomain with the values provided in the parnter portal. (If the root domain is hosted on platformOS, then you will click 'update' and then click `Commit DNS Changes`, it may be different on other DNS services.)
8. Once the nameservers are recognized, you can click `I have changed Name Servers` on the DNS Zone page.
9. Depending on how quickly the nameserver changes propagate (from a few minutes to a few hours), you may have to click `I have changed Name Servers` a few times and refresh the page a few times. Do not be concerned if some of the records you created in the hosted zone appear and dissappear in the first few minutes after you update the nameservers. Once the Hosted Zone recognizes the change in nameservers, the stats for all your records should be `OK` and you should be all set.
10. Currently this process will create a www subdomain and a redirect from the root domain to the subdomain. We need to remove that. From the Instance detail page, click on `Domains`.
11. We will improve this shortly, but for now, in the URL that appears, remove the `/pp_dns`. Example, https://partners.platformos.com/instances/5253/pp_dns/domains we would change to https://partners.platformos.com/instances/5253/domains - From this page, we will remove the redirect from root to www, and add a redirect from www to root. Click `Edit` on the root domain.
12. Make sure that `Use as default` is checked and that `redirect` is unchecked. Then click `Update Domain`.
13. Next, click on `edit` for the www subdomain.
14. Finally, make sure `Use as default` is unchecked and check `redirect`. Add the direct URL to the root domain and then choose your redirect code. Once completed, click `Update Domain`.

Congratulations! An SSL certificate has been created and applied to your instance and your domain is now LIVE!
