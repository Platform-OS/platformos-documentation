### Step 1: Locate SSL Certificate
[Find the Instance](/developer-guide/partner-portal/instances/finding-instances) connected to the domain which SSL Certificate you would like to delete.

### Step 2: Delete SSL Certificate

Click on `Certificate details`, and under Actions, click on `Delete`.
When asked if you're sure, click `OK` to confirm the deletion. The SSL Certificates page of the domain is displayed, and the SSL Certificate has been removed.
