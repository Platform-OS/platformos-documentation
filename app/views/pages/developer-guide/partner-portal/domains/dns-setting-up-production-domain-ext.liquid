  title: Setting Up a Production Domain on a 3rd-Party Provider
  description: This guide will help you set up a production domain on a 3rd-party provider.
---

This guide will help you set up a production domain. The production domain is the domain of your production Instance, your live site available to visitors.

## Requirements
To be able to set up a production domain within a 3rd Party Provider, you have to [Create a Domain with External DNS management](/developer-guide/partner-portal/domains/dns-setting-up-production-domain) first.

## Steps

### Step 1: Verify ownership
You will be asked to demonstrate control over the domain. You can do this by adding at least one CNAME record to your current DNS Zone.

Visit the domain list page, find your domain and click the `view` link. The page will display the requested CNAME record[s].

Visit your DNS provider's Control Panel and add the presented CNAME record. For more information on how to do this, please refer to your DNS provider's documentation.

It can take a few minutes for the changes to propagate. The page will refresh automatically every few minutes. If not, you can refresh the page manually.

### Step 2: Observe propagation status
You can observe the propagation status in the last column of the CNAME record table. If the status changes to `OK` then the change has been propagated to the Cloudflare DNS system.
Please note that diagnostics are only informational. DNS propagation can take up to 24h in the worst case scenario. Usually it's not longer than 1 hour.

When the status is OK the page should refresh automatically and display the `Congratulations! Your Domain is Ready` message.
If not, please click on the `OK. Done. I added requested record` button.
If you are shown the same page again it means that the propagation has not finished yet. Please try again in a few minutes.

If the propagation went well, you will see the 'Congratulations! Your Domain is Ready' message.

### Step 3: Finish setup

Go to your DNS provider's Control Panel:
1. setup forwarding to a presented DNS name.
Accordingly to your DNS provider - it will be an ANAME record or an ALIAS. Refer to your DNS provider's documentation for further instructions.
2. add www CNAME record

It can take a few minutes for the changes to propagate.

That's all. Your configuration is finished.

#### Troubleshooting
In case of any issues you can visit the `diagnostics` link.
There are two textareas which should display the same values when domain propagation is accomplished and correct.
