1. In our example, we are assuming that your domain has already been set up before with your DNS provider and all records are in place from previous usage.
2. Go to the Instance detail page in the platformOS Partner Portal: https://partners.platformos.com
3. Click `Domains`.
4. Click `Add new domain to your Instance`.
5. Click `External DNS management`.
6. Add your subdomain name (do not add www), will this be your default domain, click `Create External DNS management`
7. Refresh your page a few times until the status on the Domains page changes to `ownership_verification_pending`. Once it does, click `view`.
8. We need to validate ownership of the subdomain so, in your DNS provider, please add the required CNAME record.
9. Once you have added the CNAME, you can click `Ok. Done. I added requested records`.
10. Refresh the page a few times (this may take longer) to allow for our system to verify the CNAME. Once it's done, you'll be provided with a couple options for FQDN's depending if your DNS provider is AWS or another provider. You'll also be asked to add the www CNAME record if you have not done so already for your domain. The reason for this is we automatically set up the www subdomain and redirect the root domain to it.

### When you are ready to "Go Live", please continue.

11. Add the provided FQDN to your DNS service as an ANAME record for the subdomain. It may take some time for the DNS records to update depending on your DNS service, but normally it's only a few mintues to a few hours.

Congratulations! An SSL certificate has been created and applied to your instance and your domain is now LIVE!
