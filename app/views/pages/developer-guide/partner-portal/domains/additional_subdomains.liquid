This guide provides an overview of how to add additional subdomains to your platformOS instance using platformOS's DNS web services. These domains don't count towards your domain limits/metrics. Noting that this will only work if the subdomain does not need it's own AWS SSL certificates.

## Requirements
To be able to set up a production domain on the Partner Portal, you have to have access to the Partner Portal, have a production Instance, and you should be familiar with the recommended development workflow.

* [Register on the Partner Portal](/get-started/installation-and-configuration/#sign-up-on-the-partner-portal)
* [Create an Instance](/get-started/installation-and-configuration/#create-an-instance)
* [Development Workflow](/developer-guide/platformos-workflow/development-workflow)

## To point ANY subdomain (*.example.com) to your default domain (example.com)
Create a wildcard (*) CNAME record in your pOS hosted zone:

Name: *
Type: CNAME
Record/Value: example.com

<img loading="lazy" src="{{ 'images/developer-guide/dns/wildcard.png' | asset_url }}" alt="wildcard CNAME image" />


## To point a specific subdomain (abc.example.com) to your default domain (example.com)
Create a specific CNAME record in your pOS hosted zone:

Name: abc
Type: CNAME
Record/Value: example.com

<img loading="lazy" src="{{ 'images/developer-guide/dns/specific-subdomain.png' | asset_url }}" alt="specific subdomain CNAME image" />


## To point a specific subdomain (abc.example.com) to your instance and have it resolve as that specific subdomain
Create a specific CNAME record in your pOS hosted zone:

Vame: abc
Type: CNAME
Record/Value: example.com

<img loading="lazy" src="{{ 'images/developer-guide/dns/specific-subdomain.png' | asset_url }}" alt="specific subdomain CNAME image" />

and then go to the legacy domain page in the platformOS Partner Portal and add the new subdomain there. To get to the legacy domain page (if you don't see a button on your Instance detail page), you need to remove the /pp_dns from the URL. Example: https://partners.platformos.com/instances/5253/pp_dns/domains would be changed to https://partners.platformos.com/instances/5253/domains
