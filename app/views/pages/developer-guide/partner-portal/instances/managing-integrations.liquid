  title: Managing Integrations
---

This guide will help you set up and manage integrations with third-party services like social media or payment service providers.

platformOS can be used with built-in third-party services that we set up, but you can also build your own connection to any external API.

Currently, we support the following integrations:

* Social (OAuth)
    * Facebook
    * Google
    * LinkedIn
    * Instagram
    * Twitter
    * Github
* Security
    * reCAPTCHA
* Email
    * SendGrid
* Payments
    * Stripe

We are continuously adding new integrations.

## Requirements
To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should be able to log in to the Partner Portal, and have an Instance you created or have access to.

* [Register on the Partner Portal](/get-started/hello-world/register-partner-portal)
* [Create an Instance](/get-started/hello-world/create-instance)

## Steps
Setting up integrations for an Instance is a two-step process:

For social integrations, add the `Key` and `Secret`, then click on `Update Social integrations` to save your changes.

For Stripe, you'll need `Test login` and `Test publishable key` for the test mode, and `Live login` and `Live publishable key` for the live mode. You'll also need to select countries and currencies. Click on `Update Stripe Integration` to save your changes.
