---

The **[pos-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@platformos/pos-cli)** is a command line interface that helps you deploy configuration files and assets to your platformOS site. It expects you to follow a certain file structure to correctly communicate with the platformOS API. You do not have to use it, however, it is highly recommended that you do. It is a CLI tool, hence you are expected to have basic knowledge in working with a command line interface like Terminal.
