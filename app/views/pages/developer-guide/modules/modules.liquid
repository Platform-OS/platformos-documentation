**Modules** allow code reuse and sharing, while protecting the IP of creators.

## Directory structure

In your codebase, the `modules` directory needs to be at the same level as the `app` directory.

Module code can be split into 2 directories to protect IP (Intellectual Property). To create a module, split module code into `public` and `private` folders, and place all that code into the `modules/MODULE_NAME` directory.

```shell
app
modules
└── MODULE_NAME
    ├── public
    │   └── assets
    └── private
        └─ assets
```

`public` and `private` directories have the same structure as the standard `app` folder, but if developers try to download or preview files after the module has been deployed to an Instance, they will only be able to access the files from the `public` folder.

In general, when referencing files that are part of a module, platformOS uses a prefix which does not include any `public` or `private` folders (for example: `modules/admin/app.css` instead of `modules/admin/private/app.css`). This means that creators should not create files with the same name in both folders, as one will overwrite the other. This behavior gives creators flexibility: if they want to change the scope of the file, they can move it between the private and public folders without changing the code.

You can create an Instance and deploy the code as you would usually do, and you still can have the `app` folder on the top level (this code will not be part of the module but you can use it while developing).

This mechanism allows creators to share their module code, make it configurable (by code in the `public` folder), but still protect the IP in the `private` folder.

### Example: Module directories

An example of module code split into two directories, inside the `modules` directory:

```shell
admincms
├── private
│   └── graphql
│       ├── get_models.graphql
│       └── get_pages.graphql
└── public
    └── views
        └── pages
            └── admin.liquid
```

## Namespacing rules

Configuration files placed in a module are treated a bit differently than regular files.
To avoid conflicts between the code of a module and regular code (or between modules) a namespacing strategy is used.

The general rule of accessing files in modules is to prefix paths with `modules/MODULE_NAME`. Keep in mind that skipping resource type applies just like it does without modules. This means that when you access a `partial`, you type a path to it as if you were in the partials directory.

When you use app: `app/views/partials/users/settings/name.liquid`
Is accessed by path: `users/settings/name.liquid`

When you use module: `modules/admin/public/views/partials/users/settings/name.liquid`
Is accessed by path: `modules/admin/users/settings/name.liquid`

The only difference is the prefix.

## Examples

### Assets

You can access assets placed at `assets` directory in a module using [asset_url](/api-reference/liquid/platformos-filters#asset_url) filter.

Paths for those files are prefixed with `modules/MODULE_NAME`

##### modules/admin/public/assets/app.css

```html
{% raw %}
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="{{ 'modules/admin/app.css' | asset_url }}">
{% endraw %}
```

##### modules/admin/public/assets/admin.js

```html
{% raw %}
<script src="{{ 'modules/admin/admin.js' | asset_url }}"></script>
{% endraw %}
```

### Partials

Partials can be referenced with their shorter name - the same as the regular ones.
For example, to include partial saved as `modules/admin/private/views/partials/comments.liquid`, you should use:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% include 'modules/admin/comments' %}
{% endraw %}
```

### Layouts

Layout name has the same prefix when referenced within a page:

##### modules/admin/public/views/layouts/settings.liquid

```yaml
slug: admin/settings
layout: modules/admin/settings
```

### Records

##### modules/admin/private/models/resume.yml

```graphql
query get_resumes {
  models(
    per_page: 5
    filter: {
      model_schema_name: { value: "modules/admin/resume" }
    }
  ) {
    results {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

### Authorization Policies

##### modules/admin/public/authorization_policies/can_view_blog_posts.liquid

```liquid
{% raw %}
---
name: can_view_blog_posts
redirect_to: /blog
flash_alert: Please log in to access this page.
---
true
{% endraw %}
```

Within page/form it is referenced with a prefix:

```yaml
authorization_policies:
  - modules/admin/can_view_blog_posts
```

##### graphql Query

Query looks like any other query:

##### modules/admin/public/graphql/get_blog_instance.graphql

```graphql
query get_blog_instance(
  $current_user_id: ID
  $slug: String
  $scope: String
) {
  models(
  ...
) {
}
```

But it is referenced with the prefix:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{%- graphql bi = 'modules/admin/get_blog_instance' -%}
{% endraw %}
```

### Translations

[Translations](/developer-guide/translations/translations) YML files for module should be placed in:

##### modules/admin/public/translations/

But when used in the module code they should be prefixed:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{{ 'modules/admin/strings.sample_string' | t }}
{% endraw %}
```
