### Step 1: Buy module

Log in to the [Partner Portal](https://partners.platformos.com/), and in the menu on the left, click on `Modules`, then select `Marketplace`.

A list of available modules is displayed. Choose the module you'd like to install and click on `Buy`. The `Buy` link changes to "Bought", and you can now install the module.

### Step 2: Install module

In the menu on the left, click on `Instances`, and in the list of Instances, find the Instance you'd like to install the module on. Click on the name of the Instance.

On the bottom of the Instance page, a list of available modules is displayed. Find the module you'd like to install, and click on `Install`.

Wait a couple of minutes. The module is installed and deployed to your Instance. If there is a problem during installation, you will receive a notification via email.
