**Translations** are used for three main purposes:

* [Multi-Language sites](/developer-guide/translations/multilanguage-page): Manually translate your website and provide static copy in more than one language. You can create a `yml` file that maps the translation key to a value for each language, and then use the `t` (short for `translate`) filter in Liquid to render the proper value, based on the current userâ€™s language.

* [Date Format](/developer-guide/translations/date-format): Come up with a common format for a date, then use the `l` (short for `localize`) filter to render date and time consistently across the platform. This is useful to be able to easily change the way date/time is displayed everywhere, or to customize on a per site basis.

* [Flash messages](/developer-guide/translations/system-messages): Define system messages returned by our [API](/api-reference/rest-api).
