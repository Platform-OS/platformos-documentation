This topic describes how to internationalize form errors, authorization policies, and other system messages.

## Form validation messages

You can provide messages that will be applied to different validation errors in different languages.

There are special variables available to use inside the translation keys to make your messages look more complete.

#### Always available

* model: resource name, e.g. `car`
* attribute: attribute name, e.g. `maker`
* value: value of attribute provided by the user, which failed validation, e.g. `h000nda`

#### Contextual

* count: available in cases where there is a numeric limit/range, f.e. 180 characters passed in a field that has character limit of 140.

The default error messages are:

```yaml
en:
  errors:
    format: "%{attribute} %{message}"
    messages:
      model_invalid: "Validation failed: %{errors}"
      inclusion: "is not included in the list"
      exclusion: "is reserved"
      invalid: "is invalid"
      confirmation: "doesn't match %{attribute}"
      accepted: "must be accepted"
      empty: "can't be empty"
      blank: "can't be blank"
      present: "must be blank"
      too_long:
        one: "is too long (maximum is 1 character)"
        other: "is too long (maximum is %{count} characters)"
      too_short:
        one: "is too short (minimum is 1 character)"
        other: "is too short (minimum is %{count} characters)"
      wrong_length:
        one: "is the wrong length (should be 1 character)"
        other: "is the wrong length (should be %{count} characters)"
      not_a_number: "is not a number"
      not_an_integer: "must be an integer"
      greater_than: "must be greater than %{count}"
      greater_than_or_equal_to: "must be greater than or equal to %{count}"
      equal_to: "must be equal to %{count}"
      less_than: "must be less than %{count}"
      less_than_or_equal_to: "must be less than or equal to %{count}"
      other_than: "must be other than %{count}"
      odd: "must be odd"
      even: "must be even"
```

To override these messages, just create your own `translations/en.yml` file in the `app` folder or your module directory.

You can override only one message if you wish.

##### app/translations/en.yml

```yaml
en:
  errors:
    empty: "%{attribute} cannot be empty"
    blank: "Please fill in %{attribute}"
```

## Authorization policies

You can also use translations to internationalize the `flash_alert` property in authorization policies.

##### app/authorization_policies/always_fail.liquid

```liquid
{% raw %}
---
name: always_fail
flash_alert: "{{ 'access.fail' | t }}"
redirect_to: /multilanguage-unauthorized
---
false
{% endraw %}
```

##### app/views/pages/unauthorized.liquid

```liquid
---
slug: multilanguage-unauthorized
authorization_policies:
- modules/multilanguage/always_fail
---
```

##### app/translations/en.yml

```yaml
en:
  access:
    fail: You do not have permission to access this page.
```

##### app/translations/pl.yml

```yaml
pl:
  access:
    fail: Nie masz dostÄ™pu do tej strony.
```

This is how it works live:

* [Polish message](https://examples.platform-os.com/multilanguage-unauthorized?language=pl)
