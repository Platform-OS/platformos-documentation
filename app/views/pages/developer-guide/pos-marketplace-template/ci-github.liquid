This article describes how to set up the pOS Marketplace Template for continuous integration using GitHub actions. 

To enable GitHub actions, set your CI Instance variables. 

Variables for authenticity validation:

* `MPKIT_URL_PR`
* `MPKIT_URL_QA`

CI Instances where you want to deploy, run tests, and if the tests pass, this will trigger deploy to the live Instance:

* `MPKIT_URL_LIVE`
* `MPKIT_EMAIL`
* `MPKIT_TOKEN`


To set these variables, go to your repository settings, then enter the 'Secrets' section from the left-side navigation menu. 

Add 'repository secret' by clicking the 'New repository secret' button.

In the name field, type the name of the variable, for example:

```
Name: MPKIT_URL_QA
Value: https://your-qa-instance.example.com/
```


### How does this workflow work?

pull_requests will be triggered when someone in your repository performs a pull request. This will deploy your code to the MPKIT_URL_PR Instance, and tests will be executed.

Push_master will be triggered after merge to master. This will deploy your code to the MPKIT_URL_QA Instance, tests will be executed. If tests pass, this will trigger deploy to the live Instance.  

### Set workflow

All workflow files can be found in the `.github/workflows` directory. For complete installation instructions visit [Quickstart for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/quickstart).
