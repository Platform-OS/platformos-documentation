There are two ways to contact platformOS to send in questions, issues, or feature requests. 

## Email
	
**Create a ticket through email**

Send in your question, issue, or feature request to support@platformos.com. This will create a ticket in the platformOS Service Desk and it will be tracked and actioned on there. 

* You can add requested participants to the ticket when sending in the email by cc'ing the person/s on the email to support. Please remember to include as much information as you can so that we can find it, understand it, or recreate it.
* You can add code snippets by adding {code} at the top and bottom of the snippet.

**Respond to a ticket through email**

You can reply to any ticket by replying to the email for that ticket. Clicking on View request will take you to the ticket detail view in the platformOS Service Desk portal. You can add additional requested participants by cc'ing that person.
