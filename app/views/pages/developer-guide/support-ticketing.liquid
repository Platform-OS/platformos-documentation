Email and platformOS Zoho Desk are the two primary ways to contact platformOS to submit questions, issues, or feature requests.

## Email
	
**Create a ticket through email**

Send in your question, issue, or feature request to support@platformos.com. This will create a ticket in the platformOS Zoho Desk and it will be tracked and actioned on there. 

* You can add requested participants to the ticket when sending in the email by cc'ing the person/s on the email to support. 
* Please include as much information as you can so that we can find it, understand it, and/or recreate it.
* This includes things like: instance URL/ID, page(s), file examples, current behavior, expected behavior, when did the behavior start/stop, and anything else that you feel may be relevant.

**Respond to a ticket through email**

You can reply to any ticket by replying to the email for that ticket. Clicking on View request will take you to the ticket detail view in the platformOS Zoho Desk portal. You can add additional requested participants by cc'ing that person.
