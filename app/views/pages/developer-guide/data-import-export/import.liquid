This topic describes **data import** from the new stack.

Data to be imported needs to be in JSON format, it is an array of [user data](/api-reference/graphql/inputs#userimport) and array of [models data](/api-reference/graphql/inputs#customizationimport):

```json
{
  "users": [...],
  "models": [...]
}
```

You can generate data from an existing Instance with the `pos-cli data export` command ([read more about this here](/developer-guide/data-import-export/export#cli-export)). It will generate the `data.json` file. You can also import data from other sources (e.g. old stack, other systems) once you generate the proper JSON file. It is fairly easy to convert, for example, a CSV file into a JSON file.

## General information

- Before import, your model schemas need to be deployed.

- When importing data, the `id` fields will be changed. Relations will be kept. If you have your own relations defined in properties, you need to first describe them in model schema files - [read more about this here](/developer-guide/data-import-export/model-relations).

- If you test your imports and need to clean Instance data, use the `pos-cli data clean` command. Note, that this command will work only on staging Instances.

- When you run import twice, it will try to match previously imported data without removing existing changes. Example:
  1. You have a model `shirt` with properties: `color`, `size`
  2. First import adds new `shirt` with JSON: `{ "id": 1, "properties": { "color": "red" }}`
  3. User sets attributes of `shirt`, now `shirt` has the following properties: `{ "color": "green", "size": "large" }`
  4. Second import with the same file changes `shirt` object to: `{ "color": "red", "size": "large" }`

- Import will only do basic validations, such as the existence of properties and type validation. It doesn't check any of the validations defined on forms.

## Data Import with CLI

With pos-cli data, you can export/import Instance data (information entered by the users).


platformOS CLI provides the `pos-cli data import` command for uploading and importing data from a JSON file. It accepts one option:

- --path (short: -p): A path to a JSON data file to be imported

Under the hood, the CLI uses the GraphQL import API that's described in the next section. However, using the CLI provides some major benefits:

- Uploading file from disk
- Leveraging the CLI's authentication mechanism (i.e. you don't need to manually send your authentication token)

### Input format

The required data format is a JSON file with users and models keys that have an array of maps. Each of those collections needs to be in the same format as a corresponding GraphQL mutation. Under the hood import is just a set of mutations: [`import_users()`](/api-reference/graphql/mutations#import_users), [`import_models()`](/api-reference/graphql/mutations#import_models). When importing data using the CLI, the file should contain data in a format that matches the following structure:

```json
{
  "users": [<UserImport],
  "models": [<CustomizationImport>],
}
```

### Example

Example data import file `data.json`

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": 1000,
      "email": "tom@example.com",
      "first_name": "Tom",
      "slug": "tom"
    },
    {
      "id": 1001,
      "email": "mike@example.com",
      "first_name": "mike",
      "slug": "mike",
      "created_at": "2010-10-10 10:00:00",
      "profiles": [
        {
          "type_name": "student",
          "id": 2001,
          "properties": {
            "age": 21
          },
          "attachments": [
            {
              "name": "document",
              "url": "files/document.pdf"
            }
          ],
          "images": [
            {
              "name": "avatar",
              "url": "files/avatar.png"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "models": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "user_id": 1000,
      "type_name": "house",
      "customizable_id": 1000,
      "customizable_type": "User",
      "properties": {
        "color": "red"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "user_id": 1001,
      "type_name": "house",
      "customizable_id": 1001,
      "customizable_type": "User",
      "properties": {
        "color": "green",
        "buyer_id": 1000,
        "beach_house_id": 1
      },
      "addresses": [
        {
          "name": "foo_address",
          "address": "Warsaw",
          "postcode": "01-001"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "user_id": 1001,
      "type_name": "house",
      "properties": {
        "buyer_id": 1000,
        "beach_house_id": 2
      },
      "attachments": [
        {
          "name": "driver_licence",
          "url": "files/licence.pdf"
        }
      ],
      "images": [
        {
          "name": "headshot",
          "url": "files/headshot.png"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

To import the data from a file, simply run the following command in the terminal:

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
pos-cli data import --path=data.json staging-instance
</code></pre>

## Data Import with GraphQL mutations

It is possible to import data using GraphQL mutations. This gives you more flexibility, and even allows you to create your own import tool as a website feature. Please remember to handle authentication properly.

There are two main mutations for importing [`import_users()`](/api-reference/graphql/mutations#import_users) and [`import_models()`](/api-reference/graphql/mutations#import_models). You can create a page that will import sent data.

```graphql
mutation import_data(
    $users: [UserImport!]!,
    $models: [CustomizationImport!]!
  ) {
  import_users(users: $users) { ids }
  import_models(models: $models) { ids }
}
```

```liquid
---
slug: import_data
method: post
---
{% graphql res = "import_data",
  users: context.params.users,
  models: context.params.models

{{ g | json }}

</code></pre>

## Data Import with raw import API

Our CLI uses the HTTP API to import a data file. You can use it in your own tool.
Please note, that you need to provide your authentication token in the HTTP Authorization header of the request.

<pre class="command-line" data-output="2-6" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
curl -F "import[data]=@data.json" \
  -H "Authorization: Token token=[YOUR API TOKEN]" \
  -X POST https://example.com/api/app/imports
</code></pre>
