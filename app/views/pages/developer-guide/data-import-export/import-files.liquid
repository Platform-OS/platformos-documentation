This topic describes importing files: **images** and **attachments**.

Models and Users can store [images](/developer-guide/properties/custom-images) and [attachments](/developer-guide/properties/custom-attachments) in properties. To import them you need to have the proper data model in [*.yml files](/developer-guide/properties/user-defined). Here is an example model with images and attachments:

```yml
name: car
properties:
- name: color
  type: string
- name: car_document
  type: file
- name: car_photo
  type: image
```

## Uploading files with CLI

To import files with `pos-cli`, prepare a JSON file with paths to existing files. You need to have those files on your disk. Read more about the required structure in our [reference docs](/api-reference/graphql/inputs#customizationimport). Here is an example JSON file that assumes you have files in the `import_files/` directory:

```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "id": "id",
      "type_name": "car"
      "user_id": null,
      "properties": {
        "color": "red"
      },
      "attachments": [
        {
          "url": "import_files/offer.pdf",
          "name": "car_document"
        }
      ],
      "images": [
        {
        "url": "import_files/car.png",
        "name": "car_photo"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

During the import, `pos-cli` will upload the files to our storage and match them with corresponding records.
