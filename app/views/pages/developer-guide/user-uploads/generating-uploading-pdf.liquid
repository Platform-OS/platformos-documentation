This guide will help you generate and upload a PDF file.

## Requirements
This is an advanced tutorial. To follow it, you should be familiar with Records, Tables, and uploads.  

* [Records and Tables](/developer-guide/records/records-tables)
* [Uploads](/developer-guide/properties/uploads)
* [User Uploads](/developer-guide/user-uploads/user-uploads)

## Steps

<div data-autosteps></div>

### Step 1: Create Table

Start with a Table like this: 

##### app/schema/model_with_upload.yml

```yml
name: model_with_upload
properties:
- name: the_upload
  type: upload
```

### Step 2: Generate PDF and upload it to S3 

Once you have the Table defined in step 1, you can generate a PDF and upload it to S3 from an HTML source by passing the HTML code in "content". 
`expires_in` sets an expiration timeout for the download link, in seconds.

##### app/graphql/generate_pdf.graphql

```graphql
mutation {
  record_create(
    record: {
      table: "model_with_upload"
      properties: [ { 
        name: "the_upload"
        value_upload: {
          type: pdf
          content: "<html><head><title>Test PDF</title></head><body><h1>This will be the content of the pdf</h1></body></html>"
        }
      } ]
    }
  ) {
    id
    url: property_upload(name:"the_upload", expires_in: 600) {
      extension
      file_name
      url
      versions
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Access PDF 

If successful, the mutation will return something similar to this:

```{
  "data": {
    "record_create": {
      "id": "118",
      "url": {
        "extension": "pdf",
        "file_name": "the_upload.pdf",
        "url": "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/uploads.staging.oregon.platform-os.com/instances/xx/property_uploads/custom_uploads/file/customization/xxxx-xxxxxx/the_upload.pdf?xxxxx",
        "versions": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```
The link in `"url"` will be available for the number of seconds previously specified in `expires_in`. You may still get the S3 link after the expiration time, by using the following query, but don't forget to set a new, non-zero expiration time, otherwise the file will not be accessible:

##### app/graphql/get_pdf_requests.graphql

```graphql
query {
  records(
    per_page: 3
    filter: {
      id: { value: 57 } # use this if the id is known
      table: { value: "model_with_upload" }
    }
  ) {
    results {
      id
      url: property_upload(name:"the_upload", expires_in: 600) {
        extension
        file_name
        url
        versions
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include 'alert/tip', content: "To change the PDF's orientation, set the page size in your css to landscape: @page { size: landscape; }" %}
