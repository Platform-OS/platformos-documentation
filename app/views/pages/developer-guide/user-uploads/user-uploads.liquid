  description: Why and how platformOS implements direct S3 upload
---

File upload is often an important part of a web service or application. Usually files are uploaded to the application server, and then server sends them to a S3 (or any other cloud storage). Nowadays more tech-savvy companies are moving away from this method for couple reasons: Speed, cost and security.

Direct S3 upload is a way for developers to deliver faster experience for their users, while decreasing infrastructure cost. In this article we will present rationale why we chose to take advantage of this technology.

## Advantages

- **Less load on the application server** - Cost

  Because files are sent directly to S3, application server is not under load, no matter how much of those files are sent. This means platformOS can have lower prices - we use less servers than traditional solutions.

- **Fewer middlemen** - Speed, cost
  When user uploads files directly to S3 and skipping application server in the middle, uploaded files are faster on the target location. In traditional solution, files have to be uploaded twice, once from the user to the application server, then from the server to S3. Usually the second upload was placed in a background job (asynchronous), to queue uploads when there is a lot of them. No queues (that can be flooded) means, that there is one attack vector less if someone tried to DDoS our infrastructure.

- **Less bandwidth used** - Cost
  Because files are going straight to S3, platformOS is not using bandwidth to first receive a file, just to upload it again to S3. The bigger the scale, the bigger the savings.

- **No file processing** - Security
  Security holes in file uploads are often used to break into web application. Eliminating application server completely from this equation, and separating those concerns, mean that there is, again, one attack vector less for the attacker to exploit.

- **Less moving parts**
  There is no better code than no code. We believe that removing things that can go wrong from a system improves reliability of said system. It is easy to imagine, in an old paradigm, how a file could get uploaded to application server, but for some reason it did not get uploaded to a storage. Software is very complicated and those things happen all the time. We try hard to give them as little chance to happen as possible, and the easiest way of achieving that, is to have less of them.

## How it works

Now lets look at how things are glued together in platformOS case.

There are two types of files in platformOS

1. Attachments - Documents are any file type, that private (soon it will be configurable). `Content-Disposition` is configurable.
2. Images - Most popular graphical files on the web, i.e. jpeg, png, webp, gif, svg. Images are always public and `Content-Disposition` is always inline. This type of upload is meant to be displayed on the web.

Both types can have file size validation, so you can decide how small or big of files users will be able to upload.

### Attachments

This is high level description on what and when happens in a successful file upload flow:

1. Application: Presign URL requested via GraphQL
  To be able to upload file to S3 our server is creating presigned url. What you as developer need to do, is to get the url using `attachment_presign_url` mutation and point it to a model and property that it will be using. For example, model `documents` and property `resume`.

2. Browser: POST file
  This is the stage where `upload_url` and `upload_url_payload` - result from `attachment_presign_url` mutation - will be consumed by the browser. Combination of URL, payload and file from the user is a complete package that has to be sent over to S3.

3. S3: Return URL to file
  S3 will return status 204 and XML response with URL to file on S3, if everything went ok. Otherwise it will return status 4xx and error reason in XML format.

4. Browser: POST URL to application
  Until now platformOS doesn't know anything about the file user has been uploading. This step is meant to change that. Using any method you wish, you need to send URL to uploaded file to the application server. Because `file` is just a property in a model, you update that property just like any other.

5. Application: Save URL to the database
  After getting URL to a file from the browser, usually you want this URL to be saved in a model for future reference.

When you need URL to the file, as always, you need to use GraphQL and query for the model containing the property.

### Images

Images are mostly the same, with some additions for your convenience.

1. You can define versions that will be generated by asynchronous serverless function after the file original file have been uploaed to S3.
2. When retrieving URLs you need to specify to which version you want to get URL to.

## FAQ

1. platformOS is multi-cloud, does this mean implementation will be different for every cloud provider?
  No. It is the same for all cloud providers.
