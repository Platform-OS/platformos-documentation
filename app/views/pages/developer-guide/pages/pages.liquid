**Pages** are the most essential components of our platform, that define content displayed at a given path. All pages have to be located in the `views/pages` directory. Each page is represented by a single file with `liquid` extension.

Each page is accessible on the URL indicated by its location in the codebase if not otherwise specified in the page configuration `slug` property. For example, the page `app/views/pages/get-started/hello-world.liquid` deployed to the domain `https://example.com` will be automatically accessible at `https://example.com/get-started/hello-world`.

{% include 'alert/note', content: 'In examples, we often add the `slug` property to show where the page will be accessible, even if it would not be required because it is the same as the default.' %}

## Page configuration

All page configuration is optional, but you can use page configuration to overwrite defaults.

See below a sample page configuration file:

#### views/pages/my-page.md.liquid

```yaml
---
layout_name: my_custom_layout
converter: markdown
---
```
```liquid
# Welcome to My Page

A paragraph explaining what I do.
```

Explanation:

* `layout_name: my_custom_layout`: The page uses the layout `views/layouts/my_custom_layout.liquid`.
* `converter: markdown`: It converts markdown in the body of the page to HTML.
* `searchable: true`: It is indexed and accessible via GraphQL query.

## Available properties

| Property                 | Description                                                  | Options                                                      | Default       | Required |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- | -------- |
| authorization_policies | Array of authorization policies run before rendering the page |                                                              |               | No       |
| converter              |                                                              | markdown                                                   |               | No       |
| handler                |                                                              |                                                              |               | No       |
| layout_name            | Defines which layout from `views/layouts/` you would like to use for pages with html format. <br /><br />If you don't want to use any layout, set it to an empty string. It will be equivalent to just rendering page content.<br /><br />Note: Currently, excluding this property altogether will cause the page to use the layout last used for the current page. If no layout has been used, it will use the default `application` layout. |                                                              | `application` | No       |
| max_deep_level         | Defines what is the intended nesting level of the slug. For example, if the slug is `test` and you set max deep level to 1, then path like /test/something will raise 404. However, if you set it to 2, then it will render the page. This is useful for SEO to avoid duplicated content.                                                               | positive integer                                                               |               | No       | 3

| redirect_to            | URL to a page you want to redirect                           |                                                              |               | No       |
| response_headers       | JSON object that you can define to override most of the http headers |                                                              |               | No       |
| searchable             | Indication that this page should be indexed and accessed via GraphQL query | true                                                         | false         | No       |
| slug                   | Use the `slug` property to overwrite the default  slug.   |                                                              | The default slug is automatically created based on the page's location in the codebase. For example, a page `app/views/pages/get-started/hello-world.liquid` has the default slug `get-started/hello-world`. | No      |

Everything after the front matter is the body of the page.

## Homepage

The Homepage slug is `/`, which will work for both https://example.com and https://example.com/. The slug of the file `app/views/pages/home.liquid` defaults to `/`. See this sample file for configuring the home page:


#### views/pages/home.html.liquid

```html
<h1>Welcome to my home page</h1>
<p>A paragraph explaining what we do</p>
```

## Formats

To define which format the endpoint will be available for, place `.<format>` before the file extension.

| Format name | Example filename           |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| html      | about-us.html.liquid       |
| xml       | orders.xml.liquid          |
| csv       | users-report.csv.liquid    |
| json      | coordinates.json.liquid    |
| rss       | feed.rss.liquid            |
| css       | datepicker.css.liquid      |
| js        | server-constants.js.liquid |
| pdf       | purchase-order.pdf.liquid  |
| txt       | notes.txt.liquid           |
| ics       | calendar.ics.liquid           |


{% include 'alert/warning', content: 'For PDF it is only possible to render plain text. We are working on enhancing this feature by allowing to include images.' %}

## Accessing different formats

You can have multiple pages with the same slug, but with different formats, and access them at the same time.

For example, you can have both `html`, `pdf` and `txt` version of a page with `Hello world`:

#### views/pages/hello.html.liquid

Will be accessible under URL: `https://example.com/hello`

```liquid
Hello world
```

#### views/pages/hello.pdf.liquid

Will be accessible under the URL: `https://example.com/hello.pdf`

```liquid
Hello world
```

#### views/pages/hello.txt.liquid

Will be accessible under the URL: `https://example.com/hello.txt`

```liquid
Hello world
```

Note that the `html` format is implicit, default, you don't need to specify it in the URL.
