You can **search for a page based on its content**. For example, this might be helpful for creating search for the FAQ page.
Search will work on the rendered page version, so this page can't rely on any dynamic data, ie. `current_user` or URL params.

Page needs to be marked as `searchable: true`:

```yaml
---
...
searchable: true
---
...
```

Search query:

```graphql
query search_page(
  $value: String
) {
  pages: pages(
    filter: {
      content: {
        contains: $value
      }
    }
  ) {
    total_entries
    results {
      slug
      content
    }
  }
}
```
