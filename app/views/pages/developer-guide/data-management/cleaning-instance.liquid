This guide will help you use the `pos-cli` to clean data on your Instance.

## Requirements

This is an advanced tutorial. To follow it, you should be familiar with basic platformOS concepts, the Get Started section, and have `pos-cli` installed.

* [platformOS Workflow](/developer-guide/platformos-workflow/development-workflow)
* [Get Started](/get-started)
* [Install the pos-cli](/get-started/hello-world/install-pos-cli)


## Disclaimer

* Deleting data stored in the database using `pos-cli data clean` is **irreversible**. Caution is advised.
* `pos-cli` will ask you for confirmation, so you don't delete data by accident.
* This operation is asynchronous, which means it may take several seconds before it is completed and visible in the browser.

## Cleaning only models and users

To clear only data stored in models and users, use the `pos-cli data clean` command:

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
$ pos-cli data clean ENVIRONMENT
</code></pre>

For example:
<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
$ pos-cli data clean staging

[22:37:35] WARNING!!! You are going to REMOVE your data from instance: https://pawel-examples.staging.oregon.platform-os.com/
[22:37:35] There is no coming back.
[22:37:35]
✔ If you still want to continue please type: 'CLEAN DATA'  … CLEAN DATA
[22:37:41] Going to clean data
[22:37:43] Instance data scheduled to be clean.
</code></pre>


## Cleaning all the data from database

By adding `--include-schema` (`-i`) to the command, you can additionally remove all admin resources, pages, schemas, graphql queries, notifications.
It will not clear Instance constants (found in `context.constants`) or anything set up in the Partner Portal (test_emails, integration keys).

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
$ pos-cli data clean ENVIRONMENT --include-schema
</code></pre>

For example:
<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
$ pos-cli data clean staging --include-schema
