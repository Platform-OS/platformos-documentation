This guide will help you create an API Call Notification that pings an API endpoint when a new user signs up.

## Requirements
To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should understand the concept of notifications. You'll also use the sign-up form you created in a previous tutorial.

* [Notifications](/developer-guide/notifications/notifications)
* [Creating a Sign Up Form](/developer-guide/users/creating-sign-up-form)

## Steps

Creating an API Call Notification is a two-step process:

<div data-autosteps></div>

### Step 1: Create API Call Notification

Create an API Call Notification `notifications/api_call_notifications/ping_example_com_on_user_sign_up.liquid`:

```json
{% raw %}
---
to: 'https://example.com/endpoint/{{ form.id }}'
delay: 0
enabled: true
format: http
trigger_condition: true
callback: >
  {% log response, type: 'response object' %}
  {% assign response_hash = response.body | parse_json %}
  {% log response_hash, type: 'response body as hash' %}
request_type: POST
headers: '{
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}'
---
{
  "first_name": "{{ form.first_name }}",
  "id": "{{ form.id }}"
}
{% endraw %}
```

This defines a POST request to the endpoint with the newly created user's ID. In this example the body of the request is JSON, and to notify the endpoint about it, you set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`. If the call is successful, then the code from the `callback` property is triggered. You can access the endpoint's response via the [Response](/api-reference/graphql/objects#response) object - which includes headers, status and body. In the example, we assume the server returns valid JSON, which we parse and log.

### Step 2a: Invoke notification directly via GraphQL [api_call_send](/api-reference/graphql/mutations#api_call_send)

The API Call notification name is a path of the file relative to the `sms_notifications` directory, without extension.

For notifications/api_call_notifications/**ping_example_com_on_user_sign_up**.liquid - the bolded part is the name (physical_file_path).

To easily test your newly created API Call Notification you can trigger it using the following query:

```graphql
mutation send_api_call ($data: HashObject) {
  api_call_send(
    data: $data
    template: { name: "ping_example_com_on_user_sign_up" }
  ) {
    response { status body }
    errors {
      message
    }
  }
}
```

All parameters provided via GraphQL as `data` argument, will be accessible in every API Call Notification property as a `data` variable (or `form` to make it compatible with Form).

### Step 2b: Connect notification to sign up form

Connect the API Call Notification you created with the sign up form `forms/developer/sign_up.liquid`:

```yaml
---
api_call_notifications:
  - ping_example_com_on_user_sign_up
---
```

Whenever a user successfully signs up, the `https://example.com/endpoint/{% raw %}{{ form.id }}{% endraw %}` endpoint will be notified.

{% include 'alert/important', content: 'We do not send real text messages on staging by default. Because any error with sending real text messages on staging might be more costly than sending emails. If you want to test SMS on staging, please change `enable_sms_and_api_workflow_alerts_on_staging` flag to `true` in your Partner Portal instance configuration.' %}

## Next steps

Congratulations! You have created an API Call Notification. Now you can learn about parsing an API response.
