This guide will help you parse an API response.

In this example, you will store part of the response in a Property for later reference using GraphQL mutations in `callback`, since you are able to access response body via `response.body`.

The tutorial assumes the API returns JSON like:

```json
{
  "third_party_api_id": "id-1"
}
```

and you want store the `third_party_api_id` value (which is `id-1`).

## Requirements
To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should understand the concept of users and Properties. You'll use the user profile and API Call Notification created in previous tutorials.

* [Users](/developer-guide/users/users)
* [Properties](/developer-guide/properties/properties)
* [Creating a User Profile](/developer-guide/users/creating-user-profile) (previous tutorial)
* [Creating an API Call Notification](/developer-guide/notifications/creating-api-call-notification) (previous tutorial)

## Steps

Parsing an API response is a four-step process:

<div data-autosteps></div>

### Step 1: Create Property

As a first step, create a Property in the user profile. In this example, you will use `default_profile`.

### Step 2: Add GraphQL mutation
Add GraphQL mutation:

##### app/graphql/store_third_party_api_id.graphql

```graphql
mutation store_third_party_api_id($user_id: ID!, $third_party_api_id: String!) {
  user_update(
    id: $user_id
    user: {
      profiles: [
        {
          name: "default",
          values: {
            properties: [{ name: "third_party_api_id", value: $third_party_api_id }]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    form_name: "callback_third_party_api_id"
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Create Form
The mutation you created provides input for the Form called `callback_third_party_api_id`, so create this Form:

##### app/forms/callback_third_party_api_id.liquid

```yaml
---
resource: User
fields:
  profiles:
    default:
      properties:
        third_party_api_id:
---
```

### Step 4: Extend API Call Notification with callback

Extend the API Call Notification by adding the proper callback, which executes the mutation with the input received form the third party API:

##### app/api_calls/ping_example_com_on_user_sign_up.liquid

```liquid
{% raw %}
---
to: 'https://example.com/endpoint/{{ form.id }}'
callback: "{%- assign response_json = response.body | to_hash -%}{% graphql res = 'persist_custom_attribute', id: form.id, third_party_api_id: response_json.third_party_api_id %}"
---
{% endraw %}
```
