This guide will help you create an Email Notification to send a welcome email to a newly signed up user.

## Requirements
To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should understand the concept of notifications. You'll also use the sign-up form you created in a previous tutorial.

* [Notifications](/developer-guide/notifications/notifications)
* [Creating a Sign Up Form](/developer-guide/users/creating-sign-up-form)

## Steps

Creating an Email Notification is a two-step process:

<div data-autosteps></div>

### Step 1: Create Email Notification

Create the notification file `notifications/email_notifications/welcome_user.liquid`:

```liquid
{% raw %}
---
to: '{{ form.email }}'
delay: 0
enabled: true
trigger_condition: true
from: 'Example Marketplace <info@example.com>'
reply_to: no-reply@example.com
cc:
bcc:
subject: 'Welcome {{ form.first_name }} in our marketplace!'
layout_path: mailer
---
<h1>Hi {{ form.first_name }}!</h1>

<p>Welcome in our marketplace!</p>
{% endraw %}
```

### Step 2: Add notification to sign up form

Edit the `forms/developer/sign_up.liquid` file to associate this email with it. The email notification name is a path of the file relative to the `email_notifications` directory, without extension.

For notifications/email_notifications/**welcome_user**.liquid - the bolded part is the name (physical_file_path).

```yaml
---
resource: User
email_notifications:
  - welcome_user
---
```

Now, when you submit the form, the newly registered user should receive the email.

Please note: if you are working on a staging environment, you also need to [configure a test email](/developer-guide/partner-portal/instances/configuring-test-email), because we intercept all emails on staging to avoid spamming real users during tests.

## Next steps

Congratulations! You have created an Email Notification. Now you can learn about using email layouts.
