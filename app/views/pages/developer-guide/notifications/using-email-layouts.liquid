This guide will help you provide a layout for your Email Notifications.

## Requirements
As the concept of an email layout is the same as the concept of a layout for pages, you should understand the concepts of layouts and notifications, and should have created an Email Notification before.

* [Layouts](/developer-guide/pages/layouts)
* [Notifications](/developer-guide/notifications/notifications)
* [Creating an Email Notification](/developer-guide/notifications/creating-email-notification)

## Steps

Using email layouts is a three-step process:

<div data-autosteps></div>

### Step 1: Create email layout file

The default layout file for all emails should be located in the `views/layouts` directory. Create a file named `mailer.html.liquid`.

### Step 2: Edit email layout file

The content of an email layout is slightly different from the content of a layout for pages because it needs to be marked as an email layout.

Add the following to your email layout file `mailer.html.liquid`:

```liquid
{% raw %}
Header

{{ content_for_layout }}

Footer
{% endraw %}
```

Where {% raw %}`{{ content_for_layout }}`{% endraw %} injects the body defined in the Email Notification into the layout. Without this part, you would be sending a layout without actual content.

## Step 3: Use layout in email

To use the newly created layout in your Email Notification, set `layout_path`:

```yaml
layout_path: mailer
```

## Next steps

Congratulations! You know how to use email layouts. Now you can learn about including attachments.
