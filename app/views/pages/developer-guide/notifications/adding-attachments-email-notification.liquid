This guide will help you attach files to an Email Notification.

## Requirements
To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should understand the concept of Email Notifications. You'll use the Email Notification you created in a previous tutorial.

* [Creating an Email Notification](/developer-guide/notifications/creating-email-notification)

## Steps

Attaching a file to an Email Notification is a one-step process:

<div data-autosteps></div>

### Step 1: Include `attachments` JSON in Email Notification

Add the `attachments` JSON to the Email Notification created in a previous tutorial:

##### app/emails/welcome_user.liquid

```liquid
{% raw %}
---
to: '{{ form.email }}'
from: 'Example Marketplace <info@example.com>'
reply_to: no-reply@example.com
subject: 'Welcome {{ form.first_name }} in our marketplace!'
layout_path: mailer
attachments: >
  {
    "logo.jpg": {
      "url": "https://uploads.prod01.oregon.platform-os.com/instances/1/assets/images/svg/platformos-logo.svg"
    }
  }
---
<h1>Hi {{ form.first_name }}!</h1>

<p>Welcome in our marketplace!</p>
{% endraw %}
```

Now, when you send an email, the attachment will be included.

You can use `liquid` in the `attachments` field, as long as it evaluates to valid JSON. The expected JSON is in the following format:

```json
{
 "<file_name_user_will_see1>": {
   "url": "<url to the attachment>"
 },
 "<file_name_user_will_see2>": {
   "url": "<another url to the attachment>"
 }
}
```

You can also mark any attachment's `Content-Disposition` as `inline`.
Inline attachment means that some types of files will be displayed inside the email content by some email clients.
By default, attachments have `Content-Disposition` set to `attachment`, which means they are only available to download in email clients.

```json
{
 "my_file": {
   "url": "<url to the attachment>",
   "inline": "true"
 }
```

{% include "alert/note", content: "You can include up to 9 attachments, and the total size cannot exceed 20MB." %}

## Next steps

Congratulations! You have sent an Email Notification with an attachment. Now you can learn about creating an SMS Notification.
