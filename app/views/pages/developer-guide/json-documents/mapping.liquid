## Mapping

Mapping is the process of defining how a document, and the fields it contains, are stored and indexed.

Each document is a collection of fields, which each have their own data type. When mapping your data, you create a mapping definition, which contains a list of fields that are pertinent to the document. A mapping definition also includes metadata fields, like the _source field, which customize how a documentâ€™s associated metadata is handled.

In platformOS, you can define document type via `search_indexes` in [app/config.yml](/developer-guide/platformos-workflow/directory-structure/config.yml) file. Example mapping definition:

```yaml
search_indexes:
- docs:
    properties:
      uuid:
        type: keyword
      title:
        type: text
        fields:
          raw:
            type: keyword
      content:
        type: text
      published_at:
        type: date
      created_at:
        type: date
      price:
        type: integer
      category:
        type: keyword
      author:
        type: object
        properties:
          uuid:
            type: string
          name:
            type: text
            analyzer: english
            fields:
              raw:
                type: keyword
```

Please note that despite `search_indexes` is an array, currently we support only one document type. This limitation will be removed in the future.

The mapping you specify in platformOS is compatible with the raw ES Mapping, hence we recommend navigating to [ElasticSearch Mapping Documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.5/mapping-types.html), which describes it in detail and in the most accurate way.
