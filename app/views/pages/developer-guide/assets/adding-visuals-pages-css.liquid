This guide will help you add visuals (images) to your pages using a CSS file, and accessing and displaying the image through its relative path.

## Requirements

To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should be familiar with the required directory structure for your codebase, and understand the concepts of pages, layouts, and assets.

* [Codebase](/developer-guide/platformos-workflow)
* [Pages](/developer-guide/pages/pages)
* [Layouts](/developer-guide/pages/layouts)
* [Assets](/developer-guide/assets/assets)

## Steps

Adding visuals to your pages using a CSS file is a three-step process:

<div data-autosteps></div>

### Step 1: Create `styles` and `images` directories

If you are starting from scratch (without having created the codebase), create an `assets` directory inside `app`, then a `styles` and an `images` directory inside `assets`.

If you have already created the codebase, you can skip this step, and just locate your `app/assets/styles` and `app/assets/images` directories.

Put an image in the images directory (e.g. `logo.svg`).

### Step 2: Create CSS file

In the `styles` directory, create a `page.css` file:

```css
.logo {
  background: transparent url("../images/logo.svg") top center no-repeat;
}
```

Here, in a static CSS file, you can't use the `asset_url` filter or {% raw %}`{{ asset_url }}`{% endraw %} liquid variable to get the URL of the image on the CDN, so you have to refer to it with its relative path.

On your computer, the CSS file is in the `app/assets/styles` directory, so to point to the image file in the `app/assets/images` directory, you have to go one level up from `styles` (`..`) to the `assets` directory, and then write the path relative to there.

This directory structure corresponds to the directory structure on the CDN, so the relative path works the same way on your Instance.

### Step 3: Link to the CSS file in your layout


```html
{% raw %}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ 'styles/page.css' | asset_url }}">
{% endraw %}
```

Sync or deploy. You should see the image displayed on your page.
