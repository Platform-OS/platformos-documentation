**Assets** are files that can be served by an HTTP web server without any backend/server processing. They are usually Javascript files, stylesheets (CSS), images, documents (pdf, doc), fonts, or media (audio, video) files.

## Assets directory

The directory for assets is: `app/assets`

The directory for assets in a module is: `modules/[my_module]/public/assets`

In order to correctly communicate with the platformOS engine and API, your codebase should be organized into a specific directory structure. The root directory of your project should contain the `app` directory, and assets should be placed into the `assets` directory inside `app`.

Although only the `assets` directory is required and you can put your assets there, we recommend you further organize your assets into subdirectories inside the `assets` directory, e.g. `images`, `scripts` for Javascript files, `styles` for CSS files, etc. This is also how the `pos-cli init` command will create the codebase.

## Content Delivery Network

Assets are uploaded to a Content Delivery Network (CDN). The directory structure on the CDN corresponds to the required directory structure of your codebase, except for the beginning of the URL.

**Example**

Location of the image asset in the codebase:
`app/assets/images/svg/logo.svg`

URL of the image asset on CDN:
`https://uploads.prod01.oregon.platform-os.com/instances/1/assets/images/svg/logo.svg?updated=1586975239`

URL of the image asset on your vanity domain with no CDN involved (it is slower, CDN solution is recommended):
`https://documentation.platformos.com/assets/images/svg/logo.svg`

{% include 'alert/note', content: 'CDN host and Instance ID are dynamic and will be specific to your instance and region' %}

## Busting browser cache

When you use `asset_url` or `asset_path` filters, paths to files will be suffixed with an `updated` parameter and a number (`?updated=1586975239`). This number is an epoch timestamp indicating when the file was updated most recently. This is the mechanism to force browser to use newer version from CDN, instead of using locally cached version. This way you dont have to change file name every time content changes. You can, but you don't have to.

`updated` parameter will not be added to files that do not exist, because server doesn't know when it was last updated, since it doesn't exist.

## Accessing assets

You can access assets using three different ways (that we know of)

* relative path on the CDN - used usually in CSS files to access fonts, images.

Accessing an image in `app/assets/images/logo.svg` from a CSS file located at `app/assets/styles/app.css`:

```css
background: transparent url('../images/logo.svg') top center no-repeat;
```

* `asset_url` liquid filter - returns absolute url to the CDN with `updated` parameter

#### Example

Accessing a JavaScript file located in `app/assets/scripts/app.js` from a liquid file:

```html
{% raw %}
<script src="{{ 'scripts/app.js' | asset_url }}"></script>
{% endraw %}
```

File has been found:
`https://uploads.staging.oregon.platform-os.com/instances/335/assets/scripts/app.js?updated=1586946301`

File does not exist:
`https://uploads.staging.oregon.platform-os.com/instances/335/assets/scripts/app.js`


{% include 'alert/important', content: 'Be careful not to use a leading `/` in your path when using the `asset_url` filter.' %}

* `asset_path` liquid filter - returns relative path to instance domain (no CDN, worse performance for end users) with `updated` parameter

#### Example

```html
{% raw %}
<script src="{{ 'scripts/app.js' | asset_path }}"></script>
{% endraw %}
```

File has been found:
`/assets/scripts/app.js?updated=1586946301`

File does not exist:
`/assets/scripts/app.js`

{% include 'alert/important', content: 'Be careful not to use a leading `/` in your path when using the `asset_path` filter.' %}


## Accessing assets placed in modules

Assets in modules are namespaced to not conflict with each other. They are also accessed by prefixing the path with the `modules/[my_module]` prefix. It does not matter whether you try to access the files from a module or not, the path to the asset is the same. Which means only location of the asset file matters, not where you write the code that references it.

**Examples**

{% raw %}
File location: `modules/[my_module]/public/assets/js/app.js`

Asset url filter access: `{{ 'modules/[my_module]/assets/js/app.js' | asset_url }}`
Asset path filter access: `{{ 'modules/[my_module]/assets/js/app.js' | asset_path }}`
{% endraw %}

## Removing assets

At the moment, there is no way to just remove assets/files from S3. If for example, you only want one header image out of 6 to be present on the server, you should name the file the same while working on it — this way it will be overridden.
