Because of the modular and flexible nature of platformOS, you can build your own REST APIs in Liquid markup or build workflows to integrate email, text, or any third-party APIs, and write your own custom integrations. To make building on platformOS easier for you, we provide out of the box integrations with multiple third-party services. Explore a list of integrations we have in this article.
