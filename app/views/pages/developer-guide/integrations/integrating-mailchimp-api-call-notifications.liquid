<div data-autosteps></div>

### Step 1: Create API Call Notification

Create an API Call Notification:

* Replace `<<YOUR_API_KEY>>` with your Mailchimp API key
* Replace `<<YOUR_DC_KEY>>` with the last part of your Mailchimp API key (the part after the `-`, for example `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-us3` where `us3` is the DC_KEY)
* Replace `<<YOUR_AUDIENCE_ID>>` with your Mailchimp Audience ID. To find that follow these steps:
	1. Navigate to the Audience tab.
	2. If you have more than one audience, click the Current audience drop-down and choose the one you want to work with.
	3. Click on View Contacts.
	4. Click on the Settings drop-down and choose Audience name and defaults.
	5. In the Audience ID section, youâ€™ll see a string of letters and numbers. This is your audience ID.
* Add the payload based on the attributes in your form.

```yaml
---
name: mailchimp_new_host
to: 'https://<<YOUR_DC_KEY>>.api.mailchimp.com/3.0/lists/<<YOUR_AUDIENCE_ID>>/members/'
format: http
request_type: POST
request_headers: >
  {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "apikey <<YOUR_API_KEY>>"
  }
---
{
    "email_address":"{{ form.email }}",
    "status":"subscribed",
    "merge_fields": {
    "FNAME": "{{ form.first_name }}",
    "LNAME": "{{ form.last_name }}"
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Add API Call Notification to forms

Add the following to the front matter on your form:

```yaml
api_call_notifications:
  - mailchimp_new_host
```
