You develop your site (write code) in your **codebase** in your local environment.

## Required directory structure

In order to correctly communicate with the platformOS engine and API, your codebase should be organized into a specific directory structure. The root directory of your project should contain the app directory.

### Recommended directories and files inside the `app` and `modules/<module name>` directories

| Directory/file          | File type   | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Learn more                                                                              |

## Files in your codebase

### Views: pages, layouts, and partials

Views are divided into three categories in your codebase, each with a mandatory subdirectory: layouts, pages, and partials.

**Pages** are the most essential building blocks of a platformOS site, that define content displayed at a given path. Each page is represented by a single file with a .liquid extension.

platformOS allows Liquid pages to be used to create many different types of endpoints beyond HTML, such as JavaScript, JSON, PDF, RSS, XML, etc. The page type can be specified in the page configuration.

**Layouts** are Liquid views that store code that would normally repeat on a lot of pages and is surrounding page content (e.g. header, footer). Without layouts, pages would share a lot of duplicated code, and changing anything would become a very time consuming and error prone process. You can create as many layouts as you need, and decide which page uses which layout.

**Partials** (partial templates) allow you to easily organize and reuse your code by extracting pieces of code to their own files. They help you improve code readability and follow the principle of DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself). You can parameterize partials and use them in various places, e.g. layouts, pages, Authorization Policies, Forms.

Example directory structure of `views` with sample files:


```shell
app
└── views
    ├── layouts
    │   └── 1col.html.liquid
    ├── pages
    │   ├── index.html.liquid
    │   └── unauthorized.html.liquid
    └── partials
        └── layout
            ├── constants.liquid
            ├── foot.liquid
            ├── footer.liquid
            ├── head.liquid
            └── header.liquid
```

### Assets

**Assets** are files that can be served by an HTTP web server without any backend/server processing. They are usually Javascript files, stylesheets (CSS), documents (HTML, pdf, doc), fonts, or media (audio, video) files.

Although only the assets directory is required and you can put your assets there, we recommend you further organize your assets into subdirectories inside the assets directory, e.g. `images`, `scripts` for Javascript files, `styles` for CSS files, etc. This is also how the `pos-cli init` command will create the codebase.

Example directory structure of `assets` with sample files:

```shell
app
└── assets
    ├── fonts
    ├── images
    │   ├── favicon.ico
    ├── scripts
    │   ├── app.js
    │   ├── vendor.js
    └── styles
        ├── app.css
        └── vendor.css
```

{% include "alert/tutorial", content: "Follow our step-by-step tutorials to learn more about <a href='/developer-guide/assets/assets'>assets</a>." %}

### Forms

Just like in every web application, HTML forms are essential in platformOS. Because using plain HTML forms can get difficult to maintain with complex data structures, we provide multiple tools that make working with forms much easier.

**Forms** are the main tool for rendering forms, persisting data, and sending notifications (email/SMS/API) in a secure and customizable way.

They give you full control when defining:

* which fields for a defined resource can be persisted
* what authorization rules apply to be able to submit the form (i.e. if you want to edit a comment, you might want to specify that only the creator or the administrator is able to do it)
* what should happen when the form is submitted successfully (i.e. without validation errors), e.g. send an email/SMS Notifications or API call to a third party system
* where the user should be redirected

On top of that, you can define callbacks (either synchronous or asynchronous) for further modifications to the system using GraphQL mutations. For example, you can define a signup form that creates User records, and if the user input is valid, also creates a few sample products for them, so that they don’t have to start from scratch.

Example directory structure of `forms` with sample files:

```shell
app
└── forms
    ├── create_contact_request_form.liquid
    └── feedback_form.liquid
```

{% include "alert/tutorial", content: "Follow our step-by-step tutorials to learn more about <a href='/developer-guide/forms/forms'>forms</a>." %}

### Users

**Users** are accounts that any of your users can have. Users are identified by their unique email addresses. You can define  properties for all users in the user.yml file.

**User Profiles** are roles in the application. Each User Profile can be associated with any number of Properties and Model Schemas. All users are assigned a User Profile named Default. The difference between User Profile and Model Schema is that each user can have maximum one profile of a given name (but can have many different profiles), whereas they can have many custom models with the same name. From a practical perspective, it is very simple to create an `upsert` operation on a UserProfile (i.e. create user profile, or if it exists, update it).

Example directory structure of `user_profile_types` with sample files:

```shell
app
├── user.yml
└── user_profile_types
    ├── developer.yml
    └── client.yml
```

{% include "alert/tutorial", content: "Follow our step-by-step tutorials to learn more about <a href='/developer-guide/users/users'>users</a>." %}

### Models

**Model Schema** is an object that describes all Model objects that belong to it. Think of Model Schemas as a custom database table, which allows you to build highly customized features. Use them to group Properties, and allow the user to provide multiple values for each of them.

**Properties** are fields that you attach to a User Profile, Model Schema, etc. Think of them as custom database columns (though complex types, like attachments and images should be treated as separate database tables). We also provide some Properties to jumpstart your development.

Example directory structure of `model_schemas` with sample files:

```shell
app
└── model_schemas
    └── blog_post.yml
```

{% include "alert/tutorial", content: "Follow our step-by-step tutorials to learn more about <a href='/developer-guide/models/models-model-schemas'>Model Schemas</a> and <a href='/developer-guide/properties/properties'>Properties</a>." %}

### Notifications

**Notifications** are messages sent to platformOS users (including admins) when something happens. A message can be an email, SMS, or programmatic call to a 3rd party API.

Notifications can be delayed, and you can use Liquid, GraphQL, and trigger conditions to decide if a notification should be sent. They are a powerful mechanism used for example to welcome new users, follow up after they've added their first item, or reach out to them if they have been inactive for a while.

Each notification has its own directory:

```shell
app
└──
  ├── api_calls
  │   └── ping_example_com_on_user_sign_up.liquid
  ├── emails
  │   └── welcome_user.liquid
  └── smses
      └── welcome_user.liquid
```

{% include "alert/tutorial", content: "Follow our step-by-step tutorials to learn more about <a href='/developer-guide/notifications/notifications'>notifications</a>." %}

### Authorization Policies

**Authorization Policies** allow you to restrict access to forms and pages in a flexible way. Each form or page can have multiple policies attached to it.

Each policy is parsed using Liquid, and the system checks them in order of their appearance in the code. Depending on policy configuration, it redirects the user to a URL provided by the developer if the condition is not met or renders error status, for example 403. You can also add a flash message for the user who failed authorization.

Example directory structure of `authorization_policies` with sample files:

```shell
app
└── authorization_policies
    └── example_policy.liquid
```

{% include "alert/tutorial", content: "Follow our step-by-step tutorials to learn more about <a href='/developer-guide/authorization-policy/authorization-policy'>Authorization Policies</a>." %}

### Translations

You can use platformOS to build sites in any language, and each site can have multiple language versions. **Translations** are yml files used for multilingual sites but also used to define date formats, flash messages or system-wide default error messages like "can't be blank".

Example directory structure of `translations` with sample files:

```shell
app
└── translations
    ├── en.yml
    └── pl.yml
```

{% include "alert/tutorial", content: "Follow our step-by-step tutorials to learn more about <a href='/developer-guide/translations/translations'>translations</a>." %}

### Modules

**Modules** allow code reuse and sharing, while protecting the IP of creators.

In your codebase, the `modules` directory needs to be at the same level as the `app` directory.

Module code is split into 2 directories to protect IP. To create a module, split module code into `public` and `private` folders, and place all that code into the `modules/MODULE_NAME` directory.

These directories have the same structure as the standard `app` folder, but if developers try to download files after the module has been deployed to an Instance (`pos-cli pull`), they will only have access to the files from the `public` folder.

Example directory structure of `modules` with sample files:

```shell
app
modules
└──admincms
  ├── private
  │   └── graphql
  │       ├── get_models.graphql
  │       └── get_pages.graphql
  └── public
      └── views
        └── pages
            └── admin.liquid
```

{% include "alert/tutorial", content: "Follow our step-by-step tutorials to learn more about <a href='/developer-guide/modules/modules'>Modules</a>." %}
