Some use cases require you to select fields available for search. For example, you want to give your users the ability to search through users but only using their `first_name`.

## Profile fields

```graphql
query get_owners {
  people(query: { keyword: "John", fields: [{ name: "first_name" }] }) {
    results {
      first_name
    }
  }
}
```

Returns users whose `first_name` exactly matches `John`.
