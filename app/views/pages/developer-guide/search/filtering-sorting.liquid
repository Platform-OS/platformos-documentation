  description: Filtering and sorting using GraphQL queries.
---

Filtering using Elasticsearch is a slightly different operation from [Search](/developer-guide/search/search), but they are easy to confuse. This topic explains filtering and sorting using GraphQL queries.

## Filtering

To filter items by exact value use

* `user:` for `people`

```graphql
people(user: { first_name: "darek" }) {
  results {
    email
  }
}
```


Please note, that there is no filter argument in the customizations entry point. You specify filtering operations directly.

```graphql
{
  customizations(
    page: 1,
    per_page: 210
    properties: [
      { name: "name", value: "alpha|beta" }
    ]
    name: "company"
  ) {
    total_entries
    results {
      id
      name
      properties
    }
  }
}
```

## Sorting

Use `sort` to change your the ordering of your collection.
When sorting automatically, the `raw` field is used.

```graphql
{
  customizations(
    page: 1,
    per_page: 210
    sort: [
      { name: "properties.url", order: "ASC" }
      { name: "properties.name", order: "DESC" }
    ]
    name: "company"
  ) {
    total_entries
    results {
      id
      name
      url: property(name: "url")
      name: property(name: "name")
    }
  }
}
```
