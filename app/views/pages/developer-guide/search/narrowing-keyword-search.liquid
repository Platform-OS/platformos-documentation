---

By default, keyword search is looking in all fields of the database.

In your GraphQL query, you can specify which fields should be searched in.

If you leave the `keyword` field empty, it means you are looking for everything, so narrowing by field names will not be applied.

## Operator

Operator allows you to control how the query will be understood by our search engine.

For example, the query `capital of hungary` (subqueries: `capital`, `of`, `Hungary`):

* With operator set to `OR`, the query will be translated to `capital OR of OR Hungary` and will return results that have _any_ of those subqueries.
* With operator set to `AND`, the query will be translated to `capital AND of AND Hungary` and will return results containing _all_ of those subqueries.

Default value is `AND`.

{% include 'alert/note', content: 'Operator is applied only to the keyword query. It does not affect fields behavior.' %}

### AND Example

```graphql
query get_owners {
  people(query: { keyword: "Tanya Rose", operator: AND }) {
    results {
      first_name
      last_name
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "people": {
      "results": [
        {
          "first_name": "Tanya",
          "last_name": "Rose"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### OR Example

```graphql
query get_owners {
  people(query: { keyword: "Tanya Rose", operator: OR }) {
    results {
      first_name
      last_name
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "people": {
      "results": [
        {
          "first_name": "Rose",
          "last_name": "Smith"
        },
        {
          "first_name": "Maya-Rose",
          "last_name": "Chauhan"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Filtered fields

To learn more about filtered fields visit the [Selecting Fields for Search](/developer-guide/search/selecting-fields-available-search) topic.

### OR with filtered fields example

```graphql
query get_providers {
  people(
    query: {
      keyword: "Tanya Rose"
      operator: OR
      fields: [{ name: "last_name" }]
    }
  ) {
    results {
      first_name
      last_name
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "people": {
      "results": [
        {
          "first_name": "Helena",
          "last_name": "Rose"
        },
        {
          "first_name": "Tanya",
          "last_name": "Rose"
        },
        {
          "first_name": "Annette",
          "last_name": "Rose"
        },
        {
          "first_name": "Alba",
          "last_name": "Spirli-Rose"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### AND with filtered fields example

```graphql
query get_providers {
  people(
    query: {
      keyword: "Tanya Rose"
      operator: AND
      fields: [{ name: "last_name" }, { name: "first_name" }]
    }
  ) {
    results {
      first_name
      last_name
    }
  }
}
```

Because the above query is asking for users that have "Tanya Rose" in `first_name` or `last_name` results will be empty in this case.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "people": {
      "results": []
    }
  }
}
```

There are no users with "Tanya Rose" in the `first_name` or `last_name` fields.

## Priority

While defining which fields should be traversed in keyword search you can also force the priority of each field to make sure they will appear higher in search results (they will have higher `score`).
