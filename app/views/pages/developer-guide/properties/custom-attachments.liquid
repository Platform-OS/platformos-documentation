**Custom Attachments** are used to add one or more attachments to a Profile, or Model.

## Defining

You can enable CustomAttachments by adding a Property with `type` set to `file`, for example:

```yaml
- name: Agreement
  type: file
```

## Form configuration

The Custom Attachment attribute must be defined in a form in order to whitelist and validate the form request.

```yaml
...
fields:
  custom_attachments:
    agreement:
      file:
        validation:
          file_content_type: { allow: ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'application/pdf'] }
...
```

## Fields

Each attachment supports the following self-descriptive fields:

| Field name | Type   | Note                                              |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| file       | String | File object associated with the custom attachment |

## Displaying, updating

After setting up attachments as described above, you can further customize them in the markup for the forms:


```liquid
{% raw %}
<label>
  <span>Select file...</span>
  <input accept=".pdf,.jpg,.jpeg,.png" name="{{ form.fields.custom_attachments.agreement.file.name }}" type="file">
</label>

<button>Submit file</button>

{% if form.errors['custom_attachments.agreement.file'] %}
  <p>{{ form.errors['custom_attachments.agreement.file'] }}</p>
{% endif %}
{% endraw %}
```


The example above shows the predefined attachment tag.

## Using GraphQL to query for `CustomAttachment`

```graphql
query test_attachment_query {
  models {
    results {
      certificate: custom_attachment(name: "agreement") {
        id
        file_name
      }
    }
  }
}
```
