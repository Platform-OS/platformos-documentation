**Arrays** are used to store multiple values for the same property.

## Defining

You can use arrays by adding a property with `type` set to `array`, for example:

```yaml
- name: hobbies
  type: array
```

## Sending arrays to server

Consider a page `app/views/pages/hobbies-test.liquid` with the following content:

```liquid
{% raw %}my hobbies: {{ context.params.hobbies }}{% endraw %}
```

If you navigate to `/hobbies-test?hobbies=music&hobbies=travelling` you will learn that only the last element is displayed - travelling. To send an array of values, you need to add `[]` to the input name. Hence `/hobbies-test?hobbies[]=music&hobbies[]=travelling` displays the expected result: `["music","travelling"]`

{% include 'alert/tip', content: "If you use Forms, you do not need to remember to add `[]` to the input name - we automatically detect if the property is defined as an array and it is already part of `fields.properties.<property>.name`" %}
