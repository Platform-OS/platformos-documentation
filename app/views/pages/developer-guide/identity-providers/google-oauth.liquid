This guide will help you configure and integrate with Google OAuth.

## Requirements
To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should be familiar with Users and Identity Providers. This guide builds on previous tutorials in the **Developer Guide: Identity Providers** section.

* [Users](/developer-guide/users/users)
* [Identity Providers](/developer-guide/identity-providers/identity-providers)

### Step 1: Setup OAuth 2.0 in Google

Follow the <a href="https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158849" target="_blank">Setting up OAuth 2.0 tutorial</a> on Google's API Console Help documentation site.

* In Google, on the `Consent Screen` set `Authorized domains` to your Instance domain, for example `example.com`
* In Google, when creating credentials, set `Authorized redirect url` to `https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/auth/google/callback`

### Step 2: Configure Partner Portal -> Social Integrations

Copy `Client ID` as `Google Key` and `Client Secret` as `Google Secret`.

### Step 3: Use /auth/google on your Instance

For example, you can add a link to the "Log In / Sign Up" Liquid page that points to `/auth/google`.
