This guide will help you configure and integrate with Auth0.

## Requirements
To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should be familiar with Users and Identity Providers. This guide builds on previous tutorials in the **Developer Guide: Identity Providers** section.

* [Users](/developer-guide/users/users)

### Step 1: Create application on your auth0 account https://auth0.com/

### Step 2: In auth0 admin set Allowed Callback URLs to https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/auth/auth0/callback

### Step 3: In auth0 admin set Allowed Web Origins to https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>

### Step 4: Configure Partner Poral

Copy `Client ID`, `Client Secret` and `Domain` from auth0. Then go to `https://partners.platformos.com/instances/<YOUR INSTANCE ID>/edit`, switch to edit mode and add the following JSON to `integrations`:
```json
"auth0": {
  "client_id": "<CLIENT ID>",
  "client_secret": "<CLIENT SECRET>",
  "domain": "<domain>"
}
```

### Step 5: Use /auth/auth0 on your Instance

For example, you can add a link to the "Log In / Sign Up" Liquid page that points to `/auth/auth0`.
