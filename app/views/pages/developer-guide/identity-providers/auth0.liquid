This guide will help you configure and integrate with Auth0.

This is how Auth0 works:

1. If the user tries to use auth0 with abc@example.com and such a user does not exist an account is created. 

2. If the user tries to use auth0 with abc@example.com and such a user exists but is not connected to auth0 this is what happens: 
   * If the user is logged in as abc@example.com, connecting the accounts is allowed, next time the user will be able to log in using auth0. 
   * If the user is not logged in, an error message is displayed saying such an account exists and is not connected to auth0. 
   * If the user is logged in to a different account, they are notified that they are logged in to a different account and need to log out. 
3. If the user tries to use auth0 with abc@example.com and such a user is connected to auth0 then they are allowed to log in. 
   * If the user is not logged in, they are allowed to log in. 
   * If the user is logged in with a different email, an error message is displayed saying they need to log out. 

## Requirements

To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should be familiar with Users and Identity Providers. This guide builds on previous tutorials in the **Developer Guide: Identity Providers** section.

* [Users](/developer-guide/users/users)

## Steps

### Step 1: Create application on your Auth0 account `https://auth0.com/`

### Step 2: In Auth0 admin set Allowed Callback URLs to `https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/auth/auth0/callback`

### Step 3: In Auth0 admin set Allowed Web Origins to `https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>`

### Step 4: Configure Partner Portal

Copy `Client ID`, `Client Secret` and `Domain` from Auth0. Then go to `https://partners.platformos.com/instances/<YOUR INSTANCE ID>/edit`, switch to edit mode and add the following JSON to `integrations`:
```json
"auth0": {
  "client_id": "<CLIENT ID>",
  "client_secret": "<CLIENT SECRET>",
  "domain": "<domain>"
}
```

### Step 5: Use `/auth/auth0` on your Instance

For example, you can add a link to the "Log In / Sign Up" Liquid page that points to `/auth/auth0`.
