This guide will help you create an authentication form to log out authenticated users.

## Requirements

To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should be familiar with the required directory structure for your codebase, and understand the concept of pages and users.

* [Codebase](/developer-guide/platformos-workflow)
* [Pages](/developer-guide/pages/pages)
* [Users](/developer-guide/users/users)

## Steps

Logging out an authenticated user is a two-step process:

<div data-autosteps></div>

### Step 1: Create log out form

##### app/forms/log_out.liquid

```liquid
{% raw %}
---
name: log_out
resource: Session
---

{% form method: 'delete' %}
  <button>Log Out</button>
{% endform %}
{% endraw %}
```

The difference from logging in, is that you want to destroy the session. You have to send a DELETE request by providing the `method: delete` attribute to the `form` tag.

### Step 2: Embed the log out form

##### app/views/pages/log-out.liquid

```liquid
{% raw %}
---
slug: log-out
---
<h2>Log out</h2>
{% include_form 'log_out' %}
{% endraw %}
```

{% include 'alert/note', content: 'To set an expiration for user sessions, use the `"timeout_in_minutes":  0,` attribute in the Instance configuration settings JSON as described in the <a href="/developer-guide/partner-portal/instances/updating-instance-configuration">Updating Instance Configuration</a> tutorial. If you set the attribute to 15, for example, all users will get logged out automatically after 15 minutes of inactivity.' %}

## Next steps
Congratulations! You created a log out for authenticated users. Now you can learn about resetting a user's password:
