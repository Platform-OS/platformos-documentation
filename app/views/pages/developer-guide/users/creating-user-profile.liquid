This guide will help you create User Profiles for your platformOS site.

For the sake of the tutorials in this section, we will assume that you want to build a marketplace which connects Developers (who build marketplaces) with Clients (who want to hire them). In order to display a different UI based on their role in the marketplace, you will create two profiles: developer and client.

## Requirements

To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should be familiar with the required directory structure for your codebase, and understand the concept of users.

* [Codebase](/developer-guide/platformos-workflow)
* [Users](/developer-guide/users/users)

## Steps

Creating a User Profile is a two-step process:

<div data-autosteps></div>

### Step 1: Create yml file

Create two yml files for the two User Profiles (developer and client) in the `app/user_profile_types` directory. Name the files `developer.yml` and `client.yml`.

### Step 2: Edit User Profile

##### app/user_profile_types/developer.yml

```yaml
name: developer
properties:
  - name: enabled
    type: boolean
  - name: bio
    type: string
  - name: years_of_experience
    type: integer
  - name: hourly_rate
    type: float
```

Explanation:

* `name`: the most important setting. Its [snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) version is used in many places like Form and GraphQL.
* `properties`: the heart of User Profiles, that allow you to specify Properties for the User Profile. They are used to build customized forms that gather user input during registration for later display. They take an array of elements that consist of name and type. To learn more, check our [full Properties documentation](/developer-guide/properties/properties/).

Similarly, add content to the `client.yml` User Profile:

```yaml
name: client
properties:
  - name: enabled
    type: boolean
```

Save your User Profiles.

## Next steps
Congratulations! You have created User Profiles. Now you can create a sign-up form:
