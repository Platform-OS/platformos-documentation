A **User** is an account that any of your users can have. Each user is assumed to have a unique email address. You can define properties for all users in the user.yml file.

**User Profiles** are roles in your application. Each User Profile can be associated with any number of Properties, Images, Attachments, and Model Schemas.

## Sharing attributes across multiple profiles

If your multiple profiles happen to have the same Properties, you can extract them to a container profile which will group them.

### Example

A company has a lot of employees, but all of them have the same attributes like name, email, emergency contact, so it would be a good idea to create a profile for "employee", and then use more specific ones for specific roles in the company.

##### app/user_profile_types/employee.yml

```yaml
name: employee
properties:
  - name: name
    type: string
  - name: email
    type: string
  - name: emergency_contact
    type: string
```

##### app/user_profile_types/software_developer.yml

```yaml
name: software_developer
properties:
  - name: programming_languages
    type: string
```

##### app/user_profile_types/project_manager.yml

```yaml
name: project_manager
properties:
  - name: projects
    type: string
  ```

## Sign up forms

**Sign up forms** allow users to sign up by entering their information in a form embedded in a page.

All forms should be located in the `app/forms` directory.

{% include 'alert/note', content: 'Check out our [Creating a Sign-Up Form](/developer-guide/users/creating-sign-up-form) page to learn more about sign-up forms.' %}

## User authentication

There are a couple of ways to authenticate a user in platformOS,  the most common being through an email and password pair, which the user provided via a sign-up form.
