{%- capture content -%}This article series promotes UserProfiles and Forms, which are deprecated. We decided to reduce the learning curve by promoting explicit implementation via Liquid, Pages and GraphQL, instead of built-in features, which add magic into the mix increasing the learning curve making debugging harder. Please refer to our [Get Started](/get-started) to read up-to date articles, including [User Authentication](/get-started/build-your-first-app/user-authentication){%- endcapture -%}{%- render 'alert/deprecated', content: content -%}

This guide will help you embed a sign-up form in a page.

## Requirements

To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should be familiar with the required directory structure for your codebase, and understand the concept of pages. You'll use the sign-up forms created in a previous tutorial.

* [Directory Structure](/developer-guide/platformos-workflow/directory-structure)
* [Pages](/developer-guide/pages/pages)
* [Creating a Sign Up Form](/developer-guide/users/creating-sign-up-form) (previous tutorial)

## Steps

Embedding a sign up form is a two-step process:

<div data-autosteps></div>

### Step 1: Create page

Create a new page in the  `app/views/pages/developer` directory named `sign-up.liquid`, and another page in the `views/pages/client` directory named `sign-up.liquid`.

### Step 2: Embed form

Add `{% raw %}{% include_form 'developer_sign_up' %}{% endraw %}` to embed the previously created sign up forms into the sign up pages.

##### app/views/pages/developer/sign-up.liquid

```liquid
{% raw %}
---
slug: developer/sign-up
---
<h1>Create a Developer Account</h1>

{% include_form 'developer_sign_up' %}
{% endraw %}
```

This will display the form you created previously at https://[your-domain]/developer/sign-up.

##### app/views/pages/client/sign-up.liquid

```liquid
{% raw %}
---
slug: client/sign-up
---
<h1>Create a Client Account</h1>

{% include_form 'client_sign_up' %}
{% endraw %}
```

This will display the form you created previously at https://[your-domain]/client/sign-up.
