  title: User Research in Your Projects
  description: Why to do user research, what are the benefits.
---

**Every project has its own context.** You need to learn about that specific context to design the solution that fits best. **Research gives you** the possibility to **understand the context**. Research helps you **define who** you are designing for, **why** users need that design, and **what** to create for them.

With user research, you can **put your users in the center** of the design. You can facilitate user research to inspire your design, evaluate your solutions, and measure your impact. Regardless of the stage you are in the product development process, thereâ€™s always something valuable to learn.

Benefits of user research:
* Test your design in real life with real users.
* Recognize what is already working well in the product.
* Kill underperforming ideas early.
* Educate your team about the real needs and problems of users.
* Uncover cases that might surprise you.
* Give your product the very best chance for success.
* Save on costs by getting to know your users and build the product for their needs rather than having to change the product after development.
