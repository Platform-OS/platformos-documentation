The **[Partner Portal](https://partners.platformos.com)** is an online interface where our Partners can create, manage, and configure sites built with platformOS, and manage other users of the Partner Portal. The site created on the Partner Portal will be the site you deploy and sync your changes to during development.

* The sites created are called **Instances**. Instances have a URL, and they represent different development environments, like staging or production.
* Users of the Partner Portal are called **Partners**. Partners have the permissions to create, manage, and configure Instances. Partners can also create and manage other Partners.
