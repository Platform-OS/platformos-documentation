The **setup process** of developing a site using platformOS includes three main steps:

## Step 1: Creating an Instance

A Partner creates a new Instance through the [Partner Portal](/how-platformos-works/platformos-workflow/partner-portal). Besides creating a new Instance, the Partner has the options to update and configure existing Instances, or copy and modify the configuration of one Instance to create another with the same or similar configuration. The platformOS engine saves the Instance, which – after authorization – becomes available for developers to deploy and sync to.

What you’ll need:

* [Access to the Partner Portal](/get-started/accessing-partner-portal)

## Step 2: Creating your codebase

Developers create their codebase in a local environment. The codebase of a platformOS Instance has to follow the required directory structure.

What you’ll need:

* NPM (for [Mac](/get-started/installing-npm-mac) or [Windows](/get-started/installing-npm-windows))
* [Marketplace Kit](/get-started/installing-marketplace-kit)

## Step 3: Deploying and syncing

The Marketplace Kit deploys or syncs the codebase to the Instance.
