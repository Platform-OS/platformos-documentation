How to build developer documentation in a fully remote team for a community scattered all over the globe? In our session at [DevRelCon Earth 2020](https://2020.devrel.net/), we showed the steps and iterations in our journey of building the platformOS developer portal, and talked about the approaches, processes, and tools we used from the discovery phase that led to the platformOS team winning the UKTC Award.

## DevRelCon
