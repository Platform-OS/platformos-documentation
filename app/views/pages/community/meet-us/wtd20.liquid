***Date**: October 20, 2020
**Event**: Write The Docs Prague conference
**Speaker**: Diana Lakatos, Director of Documentation at platformOS* 

How to encourage and help your community to contribute to your developer documentation? In our session at [Write The Docs Prague 2020](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2020/), we showed you various — fully remote — processes platformOS developed to help community members contribute content and code to our UKTC Award-winning developer portal.

## Write The Docs
[Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/) is a global community of people who care about documentation. Their conferences, organized on three continents create a time and a place for the global community of documentarians to share information, discuss ideas, and work together to improve the art and science of documentation.

## Helping Your Community Contribute to Developer Documentation

**Processes**
* How we developed a fully remote editorial workflow that everyone can be a part of (developers, writers, product owners, etc.)
* Why we follow the docs as code approach and how we implemented it through GitHub
* How we facilitate the contribution of code and content
* How we continuously improve contributor experience and reward contributions

**Tools**
* How we iteratively developed our Documentation Style Guide and how we use it
* How we help contributors by providing templates for specific types of content (concept topics, tutorials, etc.)
* Why we chose the Markdown format and how we use it

**Communication**
* How we communicate with community members
* How we collect and use feedback from our community for all aspects of our documentation (content, design, navigation, etc.)
* How we encourage people to write who are otherwise not confident in their writing skills or don’t enjoy writing
* Find all talks and lightning talks from Write The Docs Prague 2020 here.
