With over 150 speakers for more than 75 sessions and hundreds of attendees, the event helps you discover real-world strategies and insights across the entire marketplace and sharing economy startup ecosystem. 

## Has Your Software Development Killed Your User Experience and SEO, Along With Your Dreams For Marketplace Superiority?

Your Marketplace solution that solves a big business problem can fail as you burn through money during the build phase. The wrong technology choice often leads to the demise of even great Marketplace ideas. 

We discussed real world Marketplaces that have won over better funded competitors, by keeping the focus on core fundamentals, 100/100 Google Lighthouse Scores and unassailable SEO dominance. 

In this presentation, Clark talked about how the technology choices made by DesksNearMe have allowed them to dominate the organic SEO results for their chosen niche/keywords and substantially boost their chances for longer term success (and minimize DesksNearMe’s risk of failing).
