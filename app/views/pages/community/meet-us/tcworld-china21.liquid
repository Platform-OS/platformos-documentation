## A Complete Docs as Code Workflow — A Case Study of the platformOS Developer Portal 

We presented a case study of the platformOS documentation and related docs as code workflows and processes. This is a summary of what we talked about:

* **Introduction**: to put everything in context, we started with introducing our team, our community, and the documentation site itself.  
* **Docs as code**: what does it mean, what are the reasons for following a docs as code approach and what are the key goals for an organization implementing it. This was a theoretical overview of docs as code in preparation for the examples and the more in-depth explanations that followed. 
* **Content**: how we produce and structure content, including how we help others to contribute content to our documentation. We presented examples of our style guide, contributor guide, and templates. We also discussed why we chose the Markdown format and how we use it. 
* **Editorial workflow**: we described the steps in our editorial workflow in detail, including how we use GitHub, how we track issues, and how the review process works. 
* **CI/CD**: finally, we discussed what continuous integration and continuous delivery mean and how each concept applies to documentation, with examples of how we built our CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions, and how we run automated tests as part of our CI/CD workflow.
