## Fireside Chat
Dan King and Leeza McKeown from [Fireside Strategic](https://www.firesidestrategic.com/) invited our founder and CEO Adam Broadway to their Fireside chat series where they are on a mission to talk with business leaders who achieve great results through human-centered strategy. They believe that businesses don’t need to choose between investing in their humans and generating profit because it’s the humans who create profit — a belief that we wholeheartedly share. In their latest episodes, they showcase how successful leaders transcend the challenges of the COVID-19 crisis.
