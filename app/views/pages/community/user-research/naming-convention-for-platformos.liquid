### Date 
May 2019

### Goal
Create a naming convention for platformOS tools, directory structure, models, and forms.

### Method
A questionnaire with quantitative and qualitative items. 21 participants shared their thoughts and provided feedback related to problematic items with explanations and suggestions.

### Results
We wanted to find better names for two key items `marketplace-kit` and `marketplace builder` and 4 other items that are important in the development process and have caused confusion before.

Related to the renaming of `marketplace-kit` users found it important that the new name should refer to the brand, explain what it is, and make it simple and quick to type. 
Results in order:   1. pos 	2. pos-cli	3. Pos-kit

SELECTED: `marketplace-kit` 		→  	**pos-cli**

Users imagined that the new name of the `marketplace_builder` should follow how other frameworks name their structure. It should also be intuitive and quick to type.  
Results in order: 1.  app   2. pos-instance  3. instance / pos-build
SELECTED: `marketplace-builder` 	→  	**app** 


Other renamed items:

* `Customization`		   →  **Model**
* `Custom Model Types`  	→ 	**Model Schemas**
* `form_configurations` 	→ 	**forms**
* `graph_queries` 		→ 	**graphql**

Users also suggested renaming other folder elements. [Read more about the results.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1onEg3fIRfEWQdSN276dRd9deyeXwS1_HjLNZrmjJOP0/edit#slide=id.g5192aee82d_0_34)
