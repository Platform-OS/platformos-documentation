  title: FINISHED Partner Portal Site Feedback
  description:  Review user interactions and diagnose issues and the main blockers in the Partner Portal.
---

### Date
November - December 2018

### Goal
Our goal was to review user interactions and diagnose issues and the main blockers in the Partner Portal.

### Method
HotJar is a feedback and analytics tool. It tells you what users did and how they interacted with the site. 

* How users interact with site elements
* Where users are going first
* Where they are facing issues


### Results
Based on user interviews we already had sections in mind that we wanted to further test in  HotJar. Summarized results related to the following sections:

* Navigation 
	* Separate create functionality to make it always available
* Instances
	* Users found the search on top useful
	* Users like that the Instance URL and the cheat sheet is available
	* Clear filter option should be more visible
	* Change the environment names for the deprecated ones 
	* Users need more explanation about the difference between the online and the active state
	* Danger zone naming is misleading and users are afraid to click on it
	* Update instructions related to partner update
	* Domain settings need documentation with an example
	* Integrations work well
* Modules
	* Move modules to a separate menu item
	* Module installation worked well
* Permissions
	* Users prefer to provide permission via email
