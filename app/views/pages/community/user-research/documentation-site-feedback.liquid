  title: FINISHED Documentation Site Feedback
  description:  Evaluate the state and direction of the documentation site development.
---

### Date
August 2018

### Goal
The goal was to collect feedback from pOS users and to be able to evaluate the state and direction of the documentation site.

### Method
We used a ten-item questionnaire in which we used five closed questions and five open-ended questions.

### Results
We asked the users to rate the documentation site with numbers where 1 is the lowest and 10 is the highest score. The users' average answer was 7. As a reason, users said that the documentation is going in the right direction (thorough, well-organized, suits various skill levels). The reason for the rating is that it's a work in progress, and users would prefer more code examples and more entry-level tutorials. Most of the users were able to find what they were looking for on the site fast or in an expected amount of time. Users like the site's continuous improvements, structure, use cases and trust the information on the documentation site.
