### Date
July 2022

### Goal
During our internal discovery we identified main topics that we wanted to further discover with our Channel Partners through interviews. 
We wanted to discover how our Channel Partners use platformOS nowadays, and what the Golden Platform means for them. We also wanted to learn about their previous module experiences in relation to their community experiences, documentation usage, and onboarding processes. 

### Method
We ran semi-structured interviews with 5 Channel Partners.

### Results
As a result, we created an affinity map by adding the interview participants’ thoughts on post-its and identified the corresponding clusters to see what the critical topics are for them.

* For the Channel Partners, a **standardized platformOS framework** means a unified, **optimized, flexible best practice collection**. Standards are not only for the current community it can also support newcomers to have a better understanding of how pOS works. 
* Related to learning how to use the platform:; Channel Partners shared that although the system was built well, it has **too many options**. Because of that flexibility, the **learning curve is more complex than expected**.
* What helped the Channel Partners to learn the platformOS best practices are the **example videos** from the pOS team. After that, as our documentation evolved, it became a critical resource for devs to learn how to use the system. 
* Channel Partners also shared that **modules** should be straightforward to manage, which means a **flexible, reusable, maintainable** result with an **outstanding performance**.
* Based on the Channel Partner interviews the **community and market opportunities** come hand in hand: by helping each other you can also grow the market opportunities.
* Channel Partners shared that related to the current pOS modules they like the mechanism of the **version uploads and the changelog**.
* We also wanted to learn about **what the Golden Platform means** for Channel Partners.
	* The Golden Platform is the **collection of standards** on how to build on platformOS.
	* All answers point out that these standards don’t need a separate branding, it is platformOS. 
	* The standards can have a name (different as Golden Platform), representing the way of doing things. Golden Platform feels more of a destination than a way. 
* As a critical point it emerged that **user research** should be part of the best practices.
