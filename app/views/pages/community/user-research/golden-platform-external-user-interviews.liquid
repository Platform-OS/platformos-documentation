  title: ONGOING - Golden Platform External User Interviews
  description: Conduct interviews with external developers to enhance the onboarding process of the platform.
---

### Date
Since September 2022

### Goal
We are planning to conduct interviews with developers to understand what is essential for them when they start to use a new platform like platformOS, how they get to understand the standards of that platform, and what their experiences are when using modules. The goal is to have a general understanding of their needs and the typical problems they are facing. We would use the result to further optimize the onboarding process of the platform.

### Who can participate
Anyone who hasn't used platformOS yet and has experience with a module approach in other platforms.

### How to join
[Contact us](mailto:uxuis@platformos.com), and we will schedule an interview with you.
