### Date

Continuous

### Goal

Our goal is to better understand what factors contribute to a great onboarding experience for new platformOS users. We conduct interviews and learn how you acquire knowledge of the system according to their skill level. We are interested in how you use the core product (pos-cli, development practices, tools), the documentation, and the Partner Portal.

### Who can participate?

Anyone who is new to platformOS and is willing to share stories of their experience so far.

### How to join

[Contact us](mailto:uxui@platformos.com) and we will schedule an interview with you.
