  description: Gather feedback from the Channel Partners to identify the most important parts in the planned processes of the Golden Platform and what they missed from the plans.
---

### Date
August 2022

### Goal
The platformOS team hosted a webinar where we introduced what we have worked on realted to the standardization process for application development (including mobile apps). We shared the development processes and plans, the UX research we conducted, and how we plan to include the community in the following steps, the component library and the next UI steps and documentation plans, the documentation module initiative, and the new onboarding plans. 
After the presentation, the goal was to gather feedback from the Channel Partners to identify the most important parts in the planned processes and what they missed from the plans. 

### Method
We held a compact workshop session during the [webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_YJeEX4L2M). We invited the webinar participants to share their feedback via a FigJam session. The task was to collect feedback on post-its, for 5 minutes, individually, related to the following topics:

* What are the most important steps in the plans?
* What do they miss from the plans?

We kept the FigJam board open for 48 hours so the Channel Partners can iterate on their thoughts, or they can add more feedback after thinking through the whole process. It was also available for other Channel Partners who could only watch the recording of the webinar.


### Results
As a result, we grouped the post-its into connected clusters to see the most important topics for hannel Partners.

* The most important aspect for hannel Partners is that they wanted to be involved as fast as possible. The community likes to see what is ready and they like to get the possibility to give feedback. They see the validation of the best practices and the standards as a key next step.
* Documentation with code examples is an important part to make it possible to get started with the understanding of the standards and the modular approach.
* The community is interested in knowing more about the technical solutions, the most important question is how the licensing will happen.
* Some of the Channel Partners weren’t sure about the value this new direction can provide. They wondered if we keep the flexibility and how the standards will reflect the community’s needs.
