  title: FINISHED - Golden Platform Module Experience Workshop 
  description:  Understanding the module architecture preferences of the platformOS team.
---

### Date
July 2022

### Goal
To get a clear picture of what the Golden Platform means for the platformOS team and how we can define modules, we ran an internal discovery phase. We had discussions with the stakeholders, defined the project, and based on the results, we ran a module experience workshop with the pOS team members.
Our goal is to better understand what module features helped them to succeed with their tasks and what could have been better.

### Method
We ran an internal workshop with the plaformOS team members. 7 participants with different backgrounds: frontend and backend developers, DevOps, product owner, UI design, and technical writer.
The task was to collect ideas based on previous experiences with modular architecture on post-its, for 5 minutes, individually, related to the following topics:

* What helped them to succeed with their module related tasks?
* What could have been better?

### Results
As a result, we created an affinity map from the post-its to see what critical topics we need to further discover with the channel partners and the external potential users.

* **Building trust** is the most important factor. When you trust a solution you know that you can **rely on the community**, on the **documentation**, that it has **transparent pricing** and future versions will be compatible with your investment.
* **Onboarding** means that the users can have a fast understanding of **compatibility** (browser support, mobile support, accessibility, etc.) and flexibility and it also explains the dev environment well to understand dependencies.
* **Community contribution** is a key to building a community. Easy contribution paths motivate users to keep contributing and the contributions themselves motivate new users to start contributing.
* **Demo content** (videos, sample data, examples) is a key part of the documentation to help new users understand and evaluate the system.
