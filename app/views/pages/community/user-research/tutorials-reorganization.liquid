  title: FINISHED Tutorials Reorganization
  description:  Improve the usability of the Tutorials section
---

### Date
May 2019

### Goal
We now have 136+ topics in our tutorial section organized into 27 groups, and we’re planning to add more. Based on user feedback, we could improve the usability of the Tutorials section by organizing the topics better. Our goal is to identify a structure that best fits users’ expectations.

### Method
We used a **card sorting exercise** to reach our goal. In this exercise, participants sort cards containing different items into groups. It helps to figure out how to group and label the information in a way that makes the most sense to our audience.

### Results
We have analyzed the results, and based on the results we concluded that seven categories can cover our 27 topics: Data management, Schema, Templates, Modules and Module examples, Partner Portal, Third-Party Systems, Best Practices. We used the similarity matrix and the category namings to identify which topics are connected and what names users suggested for them.
