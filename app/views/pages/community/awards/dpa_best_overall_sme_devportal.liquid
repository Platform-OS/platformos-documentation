## Best Overall SME DevPortal

Every DevPortal that wins a Best-in-Class award at the DevPortal Awards is considered for the Best Overall award.

For selecting the Best Overall Devportal winners, the jury inspects the developer portal from a holistic approach:

* What makes a devportal stand out against competitors?
* How do they elaborate on their strategy, UX/DX, and API documentation?

Each type of developer portal encounters its own unique challenges, available resources for innovation and scope for creativity. In the last several years the jury has been torn between these two distinctions. Therefore, two awards are selected based on whether the developer portal is for a large enterprise or small/medium enterprise (SME) as defined when the portal is nominated.

There is a requirement to fill the nominee questionnaire that collects additional narrative information that is unknown or obscure to novel developer portal visitors. The information collected helps the DevPortal Awards jury to make their winner selection.
