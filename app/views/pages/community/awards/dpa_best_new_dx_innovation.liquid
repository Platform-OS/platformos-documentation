In this article, learn about the DevPortal Awards, this year’s judges, and why we won the **Best New DX Innovation** award.

## Best New DX Innovation

The Best New DX Innovation category showcases trend setters that introduce new ways to boost developer experience, in discoverability, onboarding, developing, support, maintenance that should become the new normal for all developer portals.

The following questions indicate the award criteria for this category:

* Have you found a new or innovative way of solving a user experience problem?
* How does your devportal lead the way in boosting developer experience?
* Do you address developers differently (for example, do you pay attention to specific subgroups)?
* Is there something about your users' journey of API discovery that should be celebrated?


## Why we won

Judges emphasized that “**after creating an account, their guided onboarding process allows developers to set up a demo site in a single click, without having to validate your email address. This removes most of the onboarding friction and allows developers to discover and test their product in a few minutes**.”

We strive to continuously pay attention to everything that impacts the developer experience on the platformOS developer portal like our target audience, onboarding, contribution, editorial experience, user research, our community, accessibility, inclusiveness, and sustainability. So this is a complex task that involves everyone’s work and input from our team and our community that we are very thankful for.

**User Experience**

* **Audience**: Our main target audience is front-end developers and business owners/site builders. Our audience combines technical people with various levels of programming skills - like experienced developers, CTOs, junior developers, as well as non-technical people who come to our docs to evaluate if platformOS might be a good fit for their projects - like project owners, business analysts, and project managers.
* **Onboarding**: The platformOS Developer Portal provides comprehensive onboarding journeys to the three main segments of our target audience. Our onboarding has been recognized by the [Best Onboarding](/community/awards/dpa_best_onboarding) award at the DevPortal Awards 2021.
* **Contribution**: To make it very easy for all segments of our target audience to be involved, we offer a number of ways to contribute, taking into consideration the time contributors have, and their skill level. For some quick editing, like fixing typos or adding links, contributors can edit the content easily on the GitHub UI. For heavy editing, adding new content, or developers who prefer to use git, we provide a complete Docs as Code workflow. We thank all of our contributors by giving recognition to them on our Contributors page as well as on our GitHub repository’s README page. We provide a [Contributor Guide](https://documentation.platformos.com/community/contributor-guide), [Style Guide](https://documentation.platformos.com/community/documentation-style-guide), and [templates](https://github.com/mdyd-dev/platformos-documentation/tree/master/app/views/pages/doc-templates) for different content types.
* **Editorial workflow**: We provide a complete docs as code editorial workflow and our documentation works with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). On every code merge to our main branch our CI/CD of choice, Github Actions, runs quality checks to ensure that the website will remain operational after the changes are deployed. We are excited that our editorial workflow has won the Best Editorial Experience award at the DevPortal Awards 2021.
* **Accessibility**: We plan for accessibility from the outset during the initial design phase, and regularly test for accessibility with various tools - further validated by our Documentation site’s very high to often perfect scores in Google Lighthouse, Wave, and AChecker. Besides the technical requirements for accessibility, we think inclusive and accessible language is just as important. This is why we have added accessibility guidelines to our Style Guide and regularly review our content for inclusiveness.
* **Community**: We communicate with our amazing community through many different channels such as our community site, Slack support, and regular video conferences. We keep our community members in the loop by regularly sharing status reports outlining what we’ve achieved, what we are working on, and what we are planning for the near future. Our status reports also include calls for contribution and research participation, and the results and analysis of UX research. We share updates regarding new features, improvements, and fixes in our release notes, and we regularly share articles about best practices and general news on our blog.
* **User experience research**: Besides getting constant feedback from the community through the channels described above, we plan regular checkpoints in our process to facilitate testing and course-correction. During development activity we tie these checkpoints to development phases. At the end of each larger release we conduct user interviews and compile and share a short survey for community members to fill out. This helps us clarify the roadmap for the next development phase.

**Sustainability**

Based on total ICT emissions compared with carbon emission by country, if the Internet was a country, it would be the 7th largest polluter. What’s even more alarming is that the electricity consumption and carbon emissions from our digital lives is on a sharp increase. This is why we want to emphasize the importance of sustainability when building websites.

Some of the factors we pay attention to in order to make our developer portal sustainable:

* Green hosting
* Performance
* Image management
* Video management
* Fonts
* Web caching
* User experience
* Navigation, search
* Content management
* Search engine optimization
* Third-party tools
* Maintenance

Many of the best practices we follow are just as beneficial for the people as the planet, for example, achieving the best possible performance or providing the best user experience tailored to the needs of our audience.

Based on the Website Carbon Calculator, our developer portal runs on sustainable energy and is [cleaner than 95% of websites tested](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/documentation-platformos-com/). On Ecograder, the [platformOS Developer Portal scores 100 out of a possible 100 points](https://ecograder.com/report?site_submitted=https%3A%2F%2Fdocumentation.platformos.com%2F&report_id=bdJ0WQdzHgWqif68SuVHBTMV&type=create).

We believe it’s imperative to decrease the carbon footprint of our digital lives. As platformOS facilitates building apps and websites, we would like to lead by example and show how a developer portal can be sustainable without ever compromising on user experience.
