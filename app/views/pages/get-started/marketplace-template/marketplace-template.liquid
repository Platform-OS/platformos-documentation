The **pOS Marketplace Template** is a fully functional marketplace built on platformOS with features like user onboarding, ad listings and ads, purchase and checkout process, and online payment. Following the tutorial, you can deploy this code within minutes to have a list of working features and start customizing the back- and front-end code.

{% include 'alert/note', content: 'If you are going through the process of installing your marketplace on the platformOS Partner Portal, you will notice that some steps are slightly different than the ones described in this Get Started guide. This is because on the Partner Portal we automatically deploy your site to a new instance, while when you follow this guide, you do all steps manually.' %}

## Preview

You can preview the marketplace template at our demo site here: [getmarketplace.co](https://getmarketplace.co)

## Prerequisite: Register on the Partner Portal

{% include 'alert/important', content: 'You might already have access to the Partner Portal if a registered Partner created an account for you. If you already have a Partner Portal account, please skip this step.' %}

The [Partner Portal](https://partners.platform-os.com/) is an online interface, where you can create, manage and configure your sites (called Instances), and create and manage the permissions of other users (called Partners).

To register on the Partner Portal, go to https://partners.platformos.com/accounts/sign_up, use your GitHub or Google account, or fill in the form:


| Field   | Description                                             | Example                   |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| First Name   | Your first name                                         | John                      |
| Last Name    | Your last name                                          | Smith                     |
| Email        | Your email address                                      | john.smith@example.com |
| Password     | Your password should consist of at least six characters that are a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols.                              | Uk9bpBMJ6s                |


Once registered, you will get an email verification. Click on the Accept verification link to activate your account.

## Step 1: Install the pos-cli

The [pos-cli](/developer-guide/pos-cli/pos-cli) is a command line interface that helps you deploy configuration files and assets to your platformOS site.

{%- capture content -%}You will need a recent version of NPM (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer to install the pos-cli. NPM is distributed with Node.js, which means that by installing Node.js, you automatically get NPM installed on your computer. If you haven't installed Node.js yet, follow [this tutorial](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to install it. {%- endcapture -%}
{% include 'alert/important', content: content %}

Once you have Node.js installed, start your command-line tool (for example, Terminal on a Mac, or Git Bash on Windows), and enter:

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
npm install -g @platformos/pos-cli
</code></pre>

If your Node.js is installed for all users you might need to use sudo to install npm packages globally:

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
sudo npm install -g @platformos/pos-cli
</code></pre>

Use the following command to test the pos-cli:

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
pos-cli -v
</code></pre>

If the pos-cli has been installed correctly, running this command displays the version of your pos-cli. If the pos-cli hasn't been installed, running this command gives a command not found error.

## Step 2: Create Instance

To be able to deploy your site, you have to create an **Instance** on the Partner Portal. Instances have a URL, and they represent different development environments, like staging or production. We recommend creating a staging environment for going through the steps in this tutorial.

On the Partner Portal, in the menu on the left under `Create`, select `Instance`, and fill in the form:

| Field  | Description                                                                                     | Example           |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Name        | The name of your Instance                                                                       | mymarketplace        |
| Tags        | Enter up to 5 tags (optional). You can use tags to group your Instances, for example by project or client. | marketplace, test        |
| Partner     | Select the Partner the Instance will belong to.                                                 | MarketplacePartner |
| Data Center | Select an endpoint (staging or production).                                                     | STAGING           |

Select the `Staging/Unbilled` Billing Plan that appears, and click on the Create button. We create the Instance, and once it's done (in a couple of minutes at most), send you an email with a link to your Instance and other useful information.

## Step 3: Add Instance to pos-cli

{% include "alert/note", content: "Make sure you remember your **Partner Portal** account email and password — you will need them to authenticate your environments. If you logged in using Google or Github, go to the Instance details view in Partner Portal where you will see the pos-cli command ready for copy and paste. It shows all the parameters you need, so in this case, you won't need to remember your password." %}

On your local environment create a new directory and change to it. This is where you will put the codebase for your marketplace.

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
mkdir marketplace
cd marketplace
</code></pre>

Add your Instance to the pos-cli. This will ensure that you can use the pos-cli to download your codebase, and sync or deploy to the Instance.

Use the `pos-cli env add` command and authenticate with your **Partner Portal** credentials.

{% include 'alert/tip', content: 'You can copy this command pre-filled with your email and Instance URL from your Instance page on the Partner Portal.' %}

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
pos-cli env add [YOUR_ENV_NAME] --email [YOUR_EMAIL] --url [YOUR_INSTANCE_URL]
</code></pre>

For example:

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
pos-cli env add staging --email john.smith@example.com --url https://mymarketplace.staging.oregon.platform-os.com
</code></pre>

A message _"Environment [your Instance URL] as staging has been added successfully."_ is displayed.

## Step 4: Clone the repository

If you need to create a new project, you can initialize the directory structure using the `pos-cli init` command. You can either initialize platformOS core or download the directory structure from a given git repository and extract it in your current directory.

Create your codebase by cloning our marketplace GitHub repository.

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
pos-cli init --url https://github.com/mdyd-dev/product-marketplace-template.git
</code></pre>

## Step 5: Build assets

Install the marketplace package and any packages that it depends on then build it using npm commands.

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
npm install
npm run build
</code></pre>

## Step 6: Deploy

To be able to see your marketplace on your site, you have to deploy your codebase using the pos-cli deploy command.

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
pos-cli deploy [YOUR_ENV_NAME]
</code></pre>

For example:

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
pos-cli deploy staging
</code></pre>

A progress indicator shows that the deployment is in progress, and once it finishes, a _"Deploy succeeded after [time]"_ is displayed.

## Step 7: Set up your marketplace

To access the admin panel of your marketplace register a user with this email address: `admin@example.com`.
Enter the `Admin` section from the main menu and go to the `Marketplace Setup` section.

To set up Stripe integration:

1. Go to [https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com) and register your Stripe Connect account.
2. Copy and add the redirect URI in your [Stripe Connect settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/applications) under Integration/Redirects:
`[YOUR_INSTANCE_URL]/payments/account/success`, for example: `https://mymarketplace.staging.oregon.platform-os.com/payments/account/success`. You can find this link on your Dashboard on the `Marketplace Setup` page.
3. Enter your Stripe public key, secret key, and Stripe Connect account client ID.
   * **Marketplace Owner Fee (percent)**: The fee that the seller pays for selling through the marketplace. For example, if the product costs 50$, the buyer pays 50$, then the seller gets 50$ minus the marketplace fee. In this example, if the marketplace fee is set to 10 (percent), then the seller will get 45$. The marketplace owner would get 5$ but as a default, the marketplace owner pays the fees for using Stripe Connect, so they will get 5$ minus Stripe's fee.
   * **Stripe Publishable Key**: find under [Developers/API keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)
   * **Stripe Secret Key**: find under [Developers/API keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)
   * **Stripe Owner Connect account client ID**: find under [Integration](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/applications)
