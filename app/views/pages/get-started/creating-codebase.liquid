This guide will help you create the codebase using the pos-cli.

In order to correctly communicate with the platformOS engine and API, your codebase should be organized into a specific directory structure. The root directory of your project should contain the `app` directory.

{% include 'alert/tip', content: 'This guide explains how to create your codebase using the pos-cli. Alternatively, you can create your directory structure by <a href="/tutorials/partner-portal/instances/downloading-codebase-instance">Downloading the Codebase of an Instance</a> you created or have access to.' %}

## Requirements

You can create the codebase using the pos-cli, so you have to have it installed on your computer. This functionality is available from version 1.0.6, so make sure you update your pos-cli to the latest version.

## Steps

Creating the codebase with the pos-cli is a two-step process:

<div data-autosteps></div>

### Step 1: Create the directory structure

To create the codebase, enter:

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
pos-cli init
</code></pre>

pos-cli downloads the directory structure in a zip file, and extracts it into the current directory.

### Step 2: Explore your directory structure

Once you've downloaded the codebase, locate and explore it &ndash; this is how the directories and code of your platformOS Instances should be organized.

To learn more about the required directories and files, check out our detailed description of the [platformOS Codebase](/how-platformos-works/platformos-workflow/codebase).

## Next steps

Congratulations! You have created the codebase for your Instance using the pos-cli. You can now deploy and sync changes to your Instance.
