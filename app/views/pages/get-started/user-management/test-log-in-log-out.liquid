With the updated layout in place, your navigation now adapts automatically based on whether the user is authenticated. As you are currently logged in, you should see the Logout button.

## Logged-in state

When a user is signed in, the navigation displays:

* A welcome message that includes their email address
* A **Logout** button

<img loading="lazy" src="{{ 'images/get-started/user-management/home-welcome-logout.png' | asset_url }}" alt="Navigation showing a welcome message and logout button">

Selecting **Logout** immediately ends the session and updates the navigation.

## Logged-out state

After logging out, or when visiting the site as a guest, the navigation shows:

* A **Login** link

<img loading="lazy" src="{{ 'images/get-started/user-management/home-login.png' | asset_url }}" alt="Navigation showing Home and Login button">

## Try it out

1. While logged in, click **Log out** to end your session. The navigation should instantly switch to the logged-out version.

2. Click on the *Log in* link to visit `/sessions/new`.

3. Sign in again using the email and password you created earlier. The personalized “Welcome, email@example.com” message should reappear.

This confirms that your login and logout flow works correctly and that your application can now dynamically respond to the user’s authentication state.

## Understanding `context.current_user`

In the previous steps, you created a dynamic navigation that reacts to whether the user is logged in. This worked because the User Module exposes information about the authenticated user through helpers such as `current_profile`. Now we take a closer look at what happens behind the scenes when a user signs in.

This is a **conceptual overview** to help you understand the login flow on platformOS.

## How platformOS knows who is logged in

The key concept is: when a user is authenticated, platformOS stores their session information in `context.current_user`.

You can verify this directly. Add the following line to your layout above the `<nav>` block:

{% raw %}
```liquid
{{ context.current_user }}
```
{% endraw %}

Reload your page. When logged in, you will see a JSON-like structure printed; when logged out, it will be blank.

<img loading="lazy" src="{{ 'images/get-started/user-management/printed-out.png' | asset_url }}" alt="Printed context.current_user output">

This value is populated during the login process. Now remove this line to clean up your code.

## Where `context.current_user` Comes From

The logic responsible for creating a user session can be found in the User Module at: `modules/user/public/views/pages/sessions/create.liquid`.

This page receives the POST request from the login form (`/sessions/new`) and contains the following key line:

```liquid
sign_in user_id: user.id
```

This Liquid tag is what actually logs the user in.

## What the `sign_in` tag does

* Creates a new authenticated session
* Associates it with the user’s ID
* Stores the session identifier in a secure cookie
* Makes `context.current_user` available on all pages

In short: it receives a `user_id` and optionally a timeout, and then handles the session creation behind the scenes.

## The Full Login Flow (Simplified)

Here is what happens when a user submits the login form:

1. The user enters their **email** and **password**.
2. The system retrieves the user from the database using the email.
3. The submitted password is hashed and compared with the stored hashed password.
4. If the credentials are valid:
   * If two-factor authentication is **enabled**, the user is redirected to the verification page.
   * Otherwise, the `sign_in` tag is executed.
5. `sign_in`:
   * Generates a new session
   * Saves it in a cookie
   * Populates `context.current_user` on subsequent requests
6. Your layout checks `current_profile` and updates the navigation automatically.

From this point forward, every request from the browser includes a session cookie, and platformOS uses that to determine which user is currently authenticated.

## Why Your Navigation Updates Automatically

Once the user is signed in:

* `context.current_user` becomes available
* The `current_profile` helper loads the user’s email and profile data
* Your navigation checks whether `current_profile` exists
* If it does:

  * The **Logout** button is shown
  * The welcome message appears
* If it does not:

  * The **Login** link is shown

So this logic is driven entirely by the presence (or absence) of `context.current_user`.
