Once you install the **User Module**, your instance immediately gains a complete set of authentication and account-management pages. There is no need to create these endpoints manually. They are generated automatically and become available under predictable URLs such as:

```
/sessions/new        → Log in form  
/users/new           → Registration form  
/passwords/reset     → Password reset request  
```
<br>

To check it out, open your instance in the browser and visit `/sessions/new`. You will already see a fully working login form. The same applies to registration, and password reset. That is the power of the User Module.

These views are styled using **Common Styling**, which is installed automatically as a dependency of the User Module and you have already configured it.

## What the User Module Includes

Before continuing our user management application, it is necessary to understand what becomes available after installation. So open the following directory in your project:

```
modules/user/public/views/pages/
```

<br>

As you explore the directory, you will notice subfolders such as `authentication_links`, `oauth`, `passwords`, `profiles`, `sessions`, and `users`. Each folder maps directly to a set of endpoints that platformOS automatically exposes.

This directory contains all public-facing pages the module exposes. These include:

* login and logout flows
* registration flows
* password reset and update flows
* email update pages
* profile management pages
* two-factor authentication (TOTP) setup and verification
* OAuth integration entry points
* impersonation features for administrators

Let's continue with trying out the provided registration flow and creating a user account.
