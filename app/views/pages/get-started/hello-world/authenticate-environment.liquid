  title: Authenticate Your Environment
  description: How to specify which Instance will be which environment.

{% include "alert/note", content: "Make sure you remember your **Partner Portal** account email and password â€” you will need them to authenticate your environments. If you logged in using Google or Github, go to the Instance details view in Partner Portal where you will find the pos-cli command ready for copy and paste. It shows all the parameters you need, so in this case, you won't need to remember your password." %}

Now, you have to specify which Instance will be which environment. For example, you set up one Instance for staging, and another one for production. This information is stored in a config file.

Regardless of what your Instance is called, after you specify it as `staging`, you can refer to it as `staging` in all commands where applicable, and you won't have to use the Instance name or the URL of the Instance again.

To add your environment to the config file, run the `env add` command, and authenticate with your **Partner Portal** credentials.

{% include 'alert/note', content: 'Run all commands discussed in this tutorial in the project root directory (one level above the `app` directory).' %}

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
pos-cli env add [environment] --email [your email] --url [your Instance URL]
</code></pre>

{% include 'alert/tip', content: 'You can copy this command pre-filled with your email and Instance URL from your Instance page on the Partner Portal.' %}

Example:

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
pos-cli env add staging --email myemail@example.com --url https://example.com
</code></pre>

A message _"Environment [your Instance URL] as staging has been added successfully."_ is displayed.
