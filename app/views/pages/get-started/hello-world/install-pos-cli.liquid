The [pos-cli](/developer-guide/pos-cli/pos-cli) is a command line interface that helps you deploy configuration files and assets to your platformOS site.

{%- capture content -%}You will need a recent version of NPM (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer to install the pos-cli. NPM is distributed with Node.js, which means that by installing Node.js, you automatically get NPM installed on your computer. If you haven't installed Node.js yet, follow [this tutorial](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to install it. {%- endcapture -%}
{% include 'alert/important', content: content %}

Once you have Node.js installed, start your command-line tool (for example, Terminal on a Mac, or Git Bash on Windows), and enter:

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
npm install -g @platformos/pos-cli
</code></pre>

If your Node.js is installed for all users you might need to use sudo to install npm packages globally:

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
sudo npm install -g @platformos/pos-cli
</code></pre>

Use the following command to test the pos-cli:

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
pos-cli -v
</code></pre>

If the pos-cli has been installed correctly, running this command displays the version of your pos-cli. If the pos-cli hasn't been installed, running this command gives a command not found error.
