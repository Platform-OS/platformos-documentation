To ensure that our _Contact Us_ form correctly triggers a POST request to the `contacts/create` page, we need to modify the form action and handle the form submission properly. This involves modifying the form action, managing authenticity tokens, and ensuring the form data is sent correctly.

## Modify the form action

When you click on the _Send_ button on the _Contact Us_ form, it currently directs to the current URL with query parameters:

```html
/?contact[email]=&contact[body]=
```

We need to change this behavior so that the form submits a POST request to the `/contacts/create` endpoint.

Desired URL:

```html
/contacts/create
```

In detail, we need to modify the form in `app/views/pages/index.html.liquid` to update the action attribute to point to `/contacts/create` and ensure the method is set to `POST`.

To do that, add the following line to your `app/views/pages/index.html.liquid` file:

```html
<form action="/contacts/create" method="post">
```

#### app/views/pages/index.html.liquid

{% raw %}
```liquid
<h2>Contact Us</h2>
<form action="/contacts/create" method="post">
    <div>
        <label for="email">Email</label>
        <input type="text" name="contact[email]" id="email">
    </div>
<div>
      <textarea name="contact[body]"></textarea>
    </div>
    <input type="submit" value="Send">
  </form>
```
{% endraw %}

## Add missing authenticity token

For security reasons, especially to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, itâ€™s important to include an authenticity token in the form. This token ensures that the form submission originates from your application.

If you are using LSP, you might see a warning about the missing authenticity token:

{% # TODO: check size %}
<img loading="lazy" class="w-full" src="{{ 'images/get-started/contact-us-tutorial/lsp_authenticity_token.png' | asset_url }}" alt="LSP warning about missing authenticity token">

To fix this, add the following hidden input field within the form:

{% raw %}
```liquid
<input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token" value="{{ context.authenticity_token }}">
```
{% endraw %}

This hidden field ensures that the authenticity token is sent along with the form data, which the server will verify.

The updated form in `index.html.liquid` should look like this:

#### app/views/pages/index.html.liquid

{% raw %}
```liquid
<h2>Contact Us</h2>
<form action="/contacts/create" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token" value="{{ context.authenticity_token }}">
    <div>
        <label for="email">Email</label>
        <input type="text" name="contact[email]" id="email">
    </div>
    <div>
      <textarea name="contact[body]"></textarea>
    </div>
    <input type="submit" value="Send">
  </form>
```
{% endraw %}

## Test the form submission

Now, when you click on the _Send_ button, the form data will be sent via a POST request to the `/contacts/create` endpoint. The URL will change to `/contacts/create`, indicating that the form has been submitted as intended.

{% # TODO: check size %}
<img loading="lazy" class="w-full" src="{{ 'images/get-started/contact-us-tutorial/contact_form_post_endpoint.gif' | asset_url }}" alt="Form submission to the POST endpoint">

For example, after submission, the URL should look like this:

```html
https://contactus.staging.oregon.platform-os.com/contacts/create
```

With this setup, your form is now correctly configured to submit data to the `contacts/create` endpoint, and includes the necessary authenticity token to protect against CSRF attacks.
