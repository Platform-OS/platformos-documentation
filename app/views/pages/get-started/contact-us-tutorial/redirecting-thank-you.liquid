To complete our task, we need to redirect users to a "Thank you" page (/contacts/thanks) after they successfully submit the Contact Us form.

## Update the create.liquid file

Add the `redirect_to` logic in your `create.liquid` file to handle the redirection upon successful form submission.

#### app/views/pages/contacts/create.liquid

{% raw %}
```liquid
---
method: post
---
{% function contact = 'commands/contacts/create', object: context.params.contact %}
{% if contact.valid %}
  {% redirect_to '/contacts/thanks' %}
{% else %}
  {% render 'contacts/form', contact: contact %}
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}

This code will check if the contact creation is valid and, if so, redirect the user to the `/contacts/thanks` page. If the validation fails, it will re-render the form with the contact data.

## Create a Thank you page

Create a simple "Thank You" page that the user will be redirected to upon successful form submission.

Create a `thanks.liquid` file:
<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
app/views/pages/contacts/thanks.liquid
</code></pre>

Add content:

#### app/views/pages/contacts/thanks.liquid


```html
Thank you!
```

This file will display a simple "Thank you" message when the user is redirected to the `/contacts/thanks` URL.

```html
app
└── views
    └── pages
        └── contacts
            ├── create.liquid
            └── thanks.liquid
```

## Test redirection and database

Now that we have implemented the redirection and the thank you page, let's test to ensure everything works as expected.

Ensure that all modifications have been synced to your platformOS instance.

### Test using invalid data

Open your _Contact Us_ form and submit invalid data first. The form should re-render with error messages indicating the validation issues.

{% # TODO: check size %}
<img loading="lazy" class="w-full" src="{{ 'images/get-started/contact-us-tutorial/contactus_invalid_graphql.png' | asset_url }}" alt="Displaying validation errors on the Contact Us form">

##### Test using valid data

Now, submit the form with valid data. You should be redirected to the `/contacts/thanks` page, displaying the "Thank you!" message.

Verify that the data has been correctly stored in the [database](http://localhost:3333/database) and confirm the new contact record.

{% # TODO: check size %}
<img loading="lazy" class="w-full" src="{{ 'images/get-started/contact-us-tutorial/contactus_thanks_database.gif' | asset_url }}" alt="Verifying stored data in the database post submission">

{% render 'alert/next', content: 'Using Events to Send Confirmation Email', url: '/get-started/contact-us-tutorial/using-events' %}
