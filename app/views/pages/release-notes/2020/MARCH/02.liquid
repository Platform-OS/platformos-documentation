<h4 class="release-note release-note__improved">IMPROVED</h4>

* asset_url will always render a full path to file hosted in CDN, even if it does not exist in the manifest

<h4 class="release-note release-note__fixed">FIXED</h4>

* static_cache expire config in Page will cache Page for given time
* match filter error handling for invalid expression
* presign url - fix for path with spaces and other special characters
* deprecated current_user will return the same hash as recommended context.current_user to avoid unexpected errors
* asset_url will correctly decode the name before looking it up in the manifest
* removed legacy routes to correctly display 404 if the Page does not exist (internal error was returned instead for some edge cases like /webhooks)
