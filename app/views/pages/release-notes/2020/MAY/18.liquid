<h4 class="release-note release-note__improved">IMPROVED</h4>

* `namespace` is now an optional attribute in the `exports` tag, previously it was mandatory
* `value_int` and `value_boolean` GraphQL arguments will work also with castable string data
* added `property` argument in the `compact` filter to be better compatible with the built-in Liquid implementation
* possibility to sort by property defined in user.yml in the `users` GraphQL query
* error handling of the new import CSV mechanism

<h4 class="release-note release-note__fixed">FIXED</h4>

* fixed edge case scenario when invalid argument was provided in the `parse_json` filter
* fixed edge case scenario when resource was set to `Model` in Form
