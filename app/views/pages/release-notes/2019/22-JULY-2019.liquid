<h4 class="release-note release-note__improved">IMPROVED</h4>

* **page slug can now consist of any components**: Previously the page slug had to be maximum three levels deep. The improvement allows you to provide any slug you want, for example `/one/two/three/four/five`. However, please note that if you define page `/one/two/three/four` you won't be able to access `/one/two/three/four/five` - template slugs still work only for three-level deep slugs.
* **{% raw %}{{ form }}{% endraw %} output improved**: The `form` variable will not include magical keys anymore, the output now corresponds to the `fields` defined in form configuration.
* **`{% raw %}{{ hash }}{% endraw %}` and `{% raw %}{{ array }}{% endraw %}` will render proper JSON**: You don't need to use the `json` filter. `{% raw %}{{ users | json }}{% endraw %}` will become `{% raw %}{{ users }}{% endraw %}`. The change is backward compatible, meaning the extra `| json` is just unnecessary but does not break anything.
* **added filter by `searchable` field to `admin_pages` graphql endpoint**: With a new filter you can exclude some pages from being shown in search results.
