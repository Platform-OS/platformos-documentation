<h4 class="release-note release-note__new">NEW</h4>

* use Content-Type header to determine the [Page format](/developer-guide/pages/pages#formats)

Previously, it was required to explicitly provide the format in the URL to access a page with a different format than `html`, for example, `app/views/pages/hello.json.liquid` was accessible via `https://example.com/hello.json`, even if you made the request using the `Content-Type: application/json` header. Now, in such a scenario, we will try to load the page with the format `json` first, and if it's not available, we fall back to `html` for backwards compatibility.

<h4 class="release-note release-note__improved">IMPROVED</h4>

* error messages for various GraphQL errors related to invalid DB queries
* the [graphql tag](/api-reference/liquid/platformos-tags#graphql) can now be closed using the `{% raw %}{%- endgraphql -%}{% endraw %}` tag (with dashes). Previously, it was causing a Liquid error.

<h4 class="release-note release-note__fixed">FIXED</h4>

* edge case scenarios related to using `sort` in GraphQL queries when `related_models` / `related_users` was used
