<h4 class="release-note release-note__new">NEW</h4>

* **Added `context.device` key**: It includes information about device type, like desktop, smartphone, etc. Should save you some work.
* **Search by ID for `admin_*` queries**: Added the possibility to search by ID for `admin_*` queries. Also, added metadata to all `admin_*` resources (possible to set them via GraphQL).
* **User session timeout**: You can now change the duration of a user session to control when the user timeouts.

<h4 class="release-note release-note__improved">IMPROVED</h4>

* **Protected context.constants**: `context.constants` are now properly protected from accidental leaking. They wonâ€™t be visible when you do {% raw %}`{{ context }}`{% endraw %}, you have to explicitly call {% raw %}`{{ context.constants }}`{% endraw %}. Soon, we will add a UI to add/remove them via the Partner Portal.
