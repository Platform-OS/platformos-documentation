<h4 class="release-note release-note__new">NEW</h4>

* special route for service workers

You can put a file named `serviceworker.js` (or `sw.js`) in the `app/assets` directory and access it via `https://www.example.com/serviceworker.js` (or `https://example.com/sw.js`). In case you need more files to be accessible this way, you can add numbers to the filename, for example `serviceworker-1.js`, `serviceworker-2.js`, etc.

<h4 class="release-note release-note__improved">IMPROVED</h4>

* `model_*` mutations return `Graph::Types::Model` object instead of Customization
* performance of `user_*` mutations invoked without a form, on Instances with many UserProfiles and ModelSchemas (in some scenarios it is now faster - the improvement depends on the number of UserProfiles/ModelSchemas)

<h4 class="release-note release-note__fixed">FIXED</h4>

* handle operation name from GraphiQL editor when multiple queries are defined
* edge case random 500 error when `acceptance` validation was used
* including a partial, which included `.` in a name, but did not exist (for example `{% raw %}{% include "i_do_not.exist" %}{% endraw %}`), was preventing next partials from being found as well
