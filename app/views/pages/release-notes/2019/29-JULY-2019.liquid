<h4 class="release-note release-note__new">NEW</h4>

* **graphql `models()` can be filtered by related users**: for example you can filter `cars` by owner name
  ```graphql
    models(
      per_page: 10
      filter: {
	name: { value: "cars" }
	related_users: { join: { foreign_property: "car_id" }
	  filter: { properties: [{ name: "name" value: "Mike" }]
	  }
	}
      }
    ) { ... }
  ```
* **multilingual notifications** - added `locale` attribute to Email/SMS/API Notifications, which accepts liquid, to evaluate to the locale which should be used for translations
* **auth0 integration** - added auth0 integration and documentation on how to integrate various Identity Providers (Auth0, Facebook, Twitter etc.) with platformOS

<h4 class="release-note release-note__improved">IMPROVED</h4>

* **admin_ GraphQL mutations** - `modules/my_module_name` prefix will be automatically added to the name of notifications, authorization policies, etc., based on physical path, to make it consistent with the `pos-cli` behavior
* **layout validation** - added validation to the `layout_name` property of Page to make it impossible to assign layout which does not exist
* **validate Model belongs to the defined Model Schema** - when defining a Form with a concrete Model Schema name as resource, it will not be possible to use it to update the Model, which belongs to the different Model Schema
* **`form` and `data` in the notifications** - previously `data` was accessible if the Notification was triggered via GraphQL and `form` if it was triggered via Form. Now you can always use both, which should make it easier to re-use Notifications. Also, documentation for triggering an API Call Notifcation was updated accordingly to show both ways of triggering it.
* **validation for related resources in GraphQL** - GraphQL will return an error if you try to use invalid values (for example property name which does not exist) for related models.
