<h4 class="release-note release-note__new">NEW</h4>

* Update Page based on `physical_file_path` instead of slug.

This fixes the UX issue when `pos-cli sync` was enabled, modifying slug/format/method could create duplicated Page objects with the same physical file path.

It also fixes the UX issue which allowed you to have multiple Pages with the same slug - now uniqueness validation error will be triggered.

Last but not least - **slug became optional** - by default path to page will correspond to file path. For example `/hello/world` will display content of `app/views/pages/hello/world.html.liquid`, previously you had to define the slug as follows:

```liquid
---
slug: hello/world
---
Hello World
```

<h4 class="release-note release-note__improved">IMPROVED</h4>

* Profiler percentage output for [Profiling Slow Pages](/best-practices/backend-performance/profiling-slow-pages)

It is now easier to spot bottlenecks in profiler output.

<h4 class="release-note release-note__fixed">FIXED</h4>

Avoid race condition in *_delete_all mutations - since actual deletion takes place in the background, make sure that users created between scheduling a background task and executing it won't be deleted.
