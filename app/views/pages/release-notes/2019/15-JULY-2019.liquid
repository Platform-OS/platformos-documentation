<h4 class="release-note release-note__new">NEW</h4>

* `pos-cli`: the old `marketplace-kit` has been forked into a new package - [pos-cli](/get-started/hello-world/install-pos-cli) ([on github](https://github.com/mdyd-dev/pos-cli)). From now on `marketplace-kit` is in archive mode and will no longer be developed.

  Follow these steps to migrate from `marketplace-kit` to `pos-cli`:

  When using local node installation (for example installed using `nvm` or `brew`):

  ```shell
  npm r -g @platform-os/marketplace-kit
  npm i -g @platformos/pos-cli
  ```

  When using global node installation (use sudo if the version without it does not work):

  ```shell
  sudo npm r -g @platform-os/marketplace-kit
  sudo npm i -g @platformos/pos-cli
  ```

  From now on, use the `pos-cli` command instead of the `marketplace-kit` command, and **remember to update your scripts if they used `marketplace-kit`**.

* `form_submit` mutation was added to GraphQL: This new mutation will trigger a form submission along with invoking authorization policies and validation. It accepts two parameters: `form_name` and `params`. This way, you will be able to easily validate any user parameters against a given form configuration and persist it if valid. Most useful for creating API endpoints which re-use existing form configurations.
* Added the possibility to fetch related `users` for the `models` GraphQL query - [Model](/api-reference/graphql/model.html)

<h4 class="release-note release-note__improved">IMPROVED</h4>

* `pos-cli`: the `gui serve` will return a user friendly message if the port is already taken.
* `pos-cli`: the `audit` command will be automatically run during `deploy`; its performance has been greatly improved.
* Redesigned emails for modules in Partner Portal
* Renamed Customization to Model and CustomModelType to Model Schema - all existing occurrences of deprecated namings were removed from examples, documentation and platform.

<h4 class="release-note release-note__fixed">FIXED</h4>

* Fixed a couple of issues related to ElasticSearch type collision removal - mainly for related models
* Removed MIT license hardcoded text in Partner Portal
