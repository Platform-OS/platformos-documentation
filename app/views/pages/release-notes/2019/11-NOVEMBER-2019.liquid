#### {{ page.metadata.description }}

<h4 class="release-note release-note__new">NEW</h4>

* `join_on_property` now accepts array of ids, not only single value (visit tutorial: [Loading Related Records From an Array Property](/developer-guide/records/loading-related-records-from-array))
* added `or` filter to `users` GraphQL query

<h4 class="release-note release-note__improved">IMPROVED</h4>

* `image_presign_url` automatically includes versions defined in schema
* upgraded application server to the newest version
* allowed to prefix `layouts/` for `layout_path` property
* if there is only one rule in `or` clause in GraphQL filter then apply it (previously was ignored)
* renamed GraphQL argument `model_name` to `model_schema_name`
* renamed `model(s)` to `related_model(s)` to avoid confusion in `model_create`, `model_update` mutations
* renamed `user(s)` to `related_user(s)` to avoid confusion in `user_create`, `user_update` mutations
* deprecated a bunch of old queries/mutations/fields to not appear in GrahQL editor auto complete list
* in our GraphQL editor, everything is now sorted alphabetically, so it's much easier to find what you are looking for
* added validation to layout_path in EmailNotification to make sure the layout exists
* added new system field `content_updated_at` to `Page` to help invalidate the cache in a more efficient way

<h4 class="release-note release-note__fixed">FIXED</h4>

* accept "model_schemas" in `physical_file_path` for admin_model_schema mutation
* remove unnecessary uniqueness validation for `name`, `type` pair for property
* do not allow to override pOS private API endpoints
* do not crash when adding `assets` directory within `app/assets`
* accessing specific error codes for GraphQL validation errors via `extensions.codes.`
* properly invalidate layout cache for EmailNotification on sync/deploy/GraphQL mutation
* 500 error when confirmation validation is used in `forms` without defining corresponding virtual field
