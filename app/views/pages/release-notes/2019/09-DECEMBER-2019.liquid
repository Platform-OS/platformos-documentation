* GraphQL mutations *_delete_all mark objects as deleted sync instead of async
* [attachment_presign_url](/api-reference/graphql/rootmutation.html) url to direct S3 upload attachments with possibility for example to specify whether it is private or public
* error message for GraphQL syntax error would clearly state it is GraphQL error
