<h4 class="release-note release-note__new">NEW</h4>

* When implementing the websockets, now you are able to create `channels/<channel_name>/subscribed.liquid` which works the same as an Authorization Policy: if it evaluates to true, the user will have access to the channel, otherwise they wonâ€™t. This will prevent listening to other people's DMs, etc. If the `subscribed.liquid` file is not created, then there is no authorization and we assume this is a public channel. 
* Added new flag `do_not_add_return_to_to_authorization_policies` which can be set in [app/config.yml](/developer-guide/platformos-workflow/directory-structure/config.yml) 
* Added new filters `amount_to_fractional` and `fractional_to_amount`
