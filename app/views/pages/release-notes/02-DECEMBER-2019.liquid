<h4 class="release-note release-note__new">NEW</h4>

* update Page based on `physcal_file_path` instead of slug. This fixes UX issue - when pos-cli sync was enabled, modifying slug/format/method could create duplicate Page objects with the same physical file path. Fixes also UX issue which allowed you to have multiple Pages with the same slug - now uniqueness validation error will be triggered. Last but not least - **slug became optional** - by default path to page will correspond to file path. For example `/hello/world` will display content of `app/views/pages/hello/world`, previously you had to define slug as follows:
```
---
slug: /hello/world
---
Hello World
```

<h4 class="release-note release-note__improved">IMPROVED</h4>

* Profiler percentage output for [Profiling Slow Pages](/best-practices/performance/profiling-slow-pages)

<h4 class="release-note release-note__fixed">FIXED</h4>

Avoid race condition in *_delete_all mutations - since actual deletion takes place in a background, make sure that users created between scheduling a background task and executing it won't be deleted
