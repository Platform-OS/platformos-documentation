Join in, grow your skills, and find people who share your interest in platformOS. Learn about the many ways you can participate in our community below.

## Contribute to our documentation

We want to make it very easy for everyone to get involved, so we offer different ways to contribute according to your skill level and the time you can put in. For some quick editing, like fixing typos or adding links, you can edit the content easily on the GitHub UI. For heavy editing, adding new content, or if you prefer to use git, we provide a complete docs as code workflow. We thank all of our contributors, and display them on [our contributors page](/community/contributors) and on our GitHub repository’s README page.

* **Feedback and contribution**: You can contribute immediately from the page where you discover a problem or miss something by clicking on the feedback card. Choose from two ways: 1. add feedback or 2. contribute via GitHub. Clicking the “Contribute to this page” link opens the topic in the GitHub editor.
* **[Style Guide](/community/documentation-style-guide)**: Our style guide contains guidelines for writing technical content (e.g. language, tone, etc.) and each content type in our documentation (e.g. tutorials, concept topics, etc.).
* **Templates**: Our site uses Liquid pages, but to make editing easier for you, we write documentation content in GitHub Flavored Markdown and use a Markdown converter to turn it into Liquid. Our templates include all non-changeable content and placeholders with explanations for the parts to add. Placeholders provide information on the recommended format (e.g. title), and any requirements or limitations (e.g. maximum number of characters).
* **[Contributor Guide](/community/contributor-guide)**: We describe ways for you to get involved in our contributor guide. We made the guide as short as possible (less than a page) with links to relevant content (e.g. style guide, templates).

## Talk to us and other community members

* **Slack support** *(by invite only)*: One of our main communication channels is a dedicated Slack channel, where you can ask questions, share ideas, and get to know our team members and each other. You can share what you’ve learned, plan your module development in sync with our roadmap and each other’s projects, and allocate your resources according to what’s going on in the business and the wider community.
* **Biweekly video conference**: On every second Thursday, we have a video conference over Zoom, where community members and the platformOS team share news, demo features and modules, and have the opportunity to engage in real-time, face-to-face conversation. Our team and community members are distributed over different continents, so we try to accommodate participants in different time zones by rotating the time of this event so that everyone has the chance to participate. We also share the recording of each meeting.
* **[User experience research](https://documentation.platformos.com/community/user-research/user-research-platformos)**: Besides getting constant feedback from the community through the channels described above, we plan regular checkpoints in our process to facilitate testing and course-correction. During development, we tie these checkpoints to development phases. At the end of each larger release, we conduct user interviews and compile and share a short survey for community members to fill out. This helps us clarify the roadmap for the next development phase.

## Stay in the loop

* **[Status reports](https://www.platformos.com/blog/blog/category/Status-Report)**: Each Monday, we share a status report on our blog to keep our community updated on what we’ve achieved, what we are working on, and what we are planning for the near future. Our status reports also include calls for contribution and research participation, and the results and analysis of UX research. Subscribers can get the status reports in an email newsletter, too.
* **[Release notes](/release-notes)**: We share news of new features, improvements, and fixes in our release notes.
* **[Roadmap](/roadmap)**: Our roadmap outlines our plans for the future, usually one quarter ahead to help our Partners plan in accordance with our upcoming features and business directions.
* **[Blog](https://www.platformos.com/blog)**: We regularly share articles about best practices and news on our blog.
