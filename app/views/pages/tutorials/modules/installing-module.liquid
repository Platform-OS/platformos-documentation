### Step 1: Buy module

Log in to the [Partner Portal](https://partners.platformos.com/), and in the menu on the left, click on `Modules`, then select `Marketplace`.

You see a list of available modules. Choose the module you'd like to install and click on `Buy`. The `Buy` link changes to "Bought", and you can now install the module.

### Step 2: Install module

In the menu on the left, click on `Instances`, and in the list of Instances, find the Instance you'd like to install the module on. Click on the name of the Instance.

On the bottom of the Instance page, you can see a list of available modules. Find the module you'd like to install, and click on `Install`.

Wait a couple of minutes. The module is installed and deployed to your Instance. If there is a problem during installation, you will receive a notification via email.
