**Response Headers** is a property to define your own custom response headers for the page. To do so, pass a JSON key-value pairs to `response_headers` property, for example:

#### views/pages/xml-data.html.liquid

```yaml
slug: xml-data
response_headers: >
  {
    "Content-Type": "text/xml",
    "Some-Header": "value"
  }
```

In the example above, endpoint `/xml-data` will return it's content as XML, even though the file was saved as `html` format. This allows you to have full control over returned headers. Liquid syntax is supported.

There are few restricted header names that cannot be overwritten:

  * cache-control
  * etag
  * set-cookie
  * x-request-id
  * x-xss-protection
