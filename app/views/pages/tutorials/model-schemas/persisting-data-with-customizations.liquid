Let's use the example to see exactly what is happening at each stage of Model Schema definition life cycle.

## Step 1: Requirements

I want to store my "todo list" in platformOS

**Todo list:**

| Task                 | Priority |
|----------------------|----------|
| Clean the apartment  | Low      |
| Do the homework      | High     |


## Step 2: Model Schema File
Create definition file in your project repository that will describe my Model Schema:

```bash
touch app/model_schemas/todo.yml
```

## Step 3: Definition of Model Schema
Using the editor of choice, add the definition of Model Schema.

The code below is the description of properties that Customization will accept and the name of Model Schema object that is used to identify the object.
For full list of Types that can be used see [CustomAttribute Types](/tutorials/properties/user-defined#property-types)

```yaml
name: todo
properties:
- name: task
  type: string
- name: priority
  type: string
```

## Step 4: Sync/Deploy Model Schema definition.

At the moment of deploy marketplace-kit is asking platformOS if Model Schema object with name `todo` already exists, if so it will be updated with given definition otherwise new object is created.

You can verify this step with GraphQL query:

```graphql
{
  admin_model_schemas {
    results {
      name
      properties {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

the result for that query depending on your instance state should be similar to:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "admin_model_schemas": {
      "results": [
        {
          "name": "todo",
          "properties": [
            {
              "name": "task"
            },
            {
              "name": "priority"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Customization Creation

In [Building Contact Form With Customization tutorial](/tutorials/customizations/building-contact-form-with-customization) you will learn in details how to create Customizations.

## Step 6: Model Schema change

  As you know by now Customizations and Model Schema objects are strictly related as the definition of properties allows for storing the data in platformOS backend systems.
  Once you have data persisted within Customization you need to be aware of how changes in CustomModelType affect your Customization objects:

  * **custom model type definition delete** - you can only delete your Model Schema object if there is no related Customization object. Use [customizations_delete_all](/api-reference/graphql/mutations#customizations_delete_all) mutation to delete all related Customization objects.

      If you try to deploy with orphaned Customization, you will see the following message:

      ```bash
      Cannot delete record because of dependent customization of type: todo
      Use the mutation below to remove dependent objects:
      mutation { customizations_delete_all(model_schema_name: "todo") { count } }
      ```
  * **name change** - as platformOS detects ModelSchema definition by its name, if you change it is equal with adding new ModelSchema, please note that Customization objects are not automatically migrated and will be treated as orphaned with next deploy attempt, see error message above.
  * **add new custom model type property** - adding new properties is a valid change that does not need additional actions, the data remains untouched.
  * **delete of custom model type property** - deletion of the property is a valid change, data stored in related Customization properties will remain saved but will not be accessible. Use migration to remove the data prior to the change.
  * **property edition** - is a valid change and is equal to the removal of property with old name and creation of new property, data is not migrated.


## Step 7: Mutations

What you have done in steps 2, 3 and 4 can be done with [admin_model_schema_create](/api-reference/graphql/mutations#admin_model_schema_create/) mutation.
In your platformOS instance, the result would be exactly the same, but you can now create CMS system where the user can define their own models with a few clicks in the user interface.
Please note that the same rules apply for Model Schema deletion as when you delete it with marketplace-kit
