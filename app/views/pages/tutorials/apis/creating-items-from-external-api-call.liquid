This guide will help you create items from an external API call. The example shows the steps of creating a Model from existing data through an API call to our service.

## Requirements
This is an advanced tutorial. To follow it, you should be familiar with basic platformOS concepts, HTML, Liquid, APIs and Form Configurations, and the topics in the Get Started section.

* [How platformOS Works](/how-platformos-works)
* [Get Started](/get-started)
* [APIs and Form Configurations](/tutorials/forms/form-configurations)
* [Building a Contact Form with Model](/tutorials/models/building-contact-form-with-model)

## Steps

Creating items from an external API call is a four-step process:

<div data-autosteps></div>

### Step 1: Create CustomModelType

Create the following CustomModelType:

#### model_schemas/flowers.yml

```yaml
name: flower
properties:
- name: name
  type: string
- name: creator_id
  type: integer
```

### Step 2: Create FormConfiguration

Define what data you expect, and required validations:

#### form_configurations/import_flowers.liquid

```yaml
---
name: import_flowers
resource: flower
fields:
  properties:
    name:
      validation:
        presence: true
    creator_id:
      validation:
        presence: true
resource_owner: anyone
---
```

### Step 3: Generate API token

Generate API token from instance admin [Settings -> API Keys -> Generate new API Key].

### Step 4: Create curl command

Here is an example POST request you need to send. You need to set:

* the token in the header
* data payload in a JSON format

<pre class="command-line" data-output="2-50" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
curl https://example.platform-os.com/api/user/models
  -H "Authorization: Token token=[YOUR API TOKEN]"
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
  --data '{"form": { "properties_attributes: {"name": "Red flowers", "creator_id":"1" }}, "form_configuration_name": "import_flowers", "parent_object_class":"CustomModelType","parent_object_id":"flower"}'
</code></pre>
