Up to this point, you have implemented user registration, login, logout, and dynamic navigation using the `current_profile` helper. Your application can now recognize who is signed in and display different UI elements based on whether a user is authenticated.

The next step is to introduce authorization - controlling what a user is allowed to do once they are logged in.

User Module provides a flexible Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. It separates two important concepts:

* Authentication (Who are you?)
* Authorization (What are you allowed to do?)

## Why this matters

As your application grows, you will likely introduce:

* Administrative dashboards
* User-only areas
* Organization-specific access rules
* Custom actions available only to certain roles

A clear understanding of the User Module's authentication and authorization model makes sure that your application is secure, predictable, and easy to maintain.

To demonstrate how RBAC works, you will create a new endpoint and restrict it so that only users with a specific role (for example, `admin` or `manager`) can access it.

## Add Admin link

To begin working with authorization, you will first add an Admin link to your navigation and create a simple page that the link points to. Later, you will protect this page so that only users with the correct permission can view it.

Go to your `app/views/layouts/application.liquid` layout, and extend the navigation by adding an `/admin` link. Place it directly after the welcome message so it appears only for authenticated users:

#### app/views/layouts/application.liquid
{% raw %}
```liquid
<nav>
  <a href="/">Home</a>
  <ul>
    {% if current_profile %}
      <li>Welcome, {{ current_profile.email }}</li>
      <li><a href="/admin">Admin</a></li>
      <form method="post" action="/sessions">
        <input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token" value="{{ context.authenticity_token }}">
        <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="delete">
        <button class="pos-button" type="submit">Logout</button>
      </form>

    {% else %}
      <li><a href="/sessions/new">Login</a></li>
    {% endif %}
  </ul>
</nav>
{{ content_for_layout }}
```
{% endraw %}

After saving and deploying (or syncing), reload your instance in the browser. If you are logged in, you will now see the Admin link appear in the navigation.

<img loading="lazy" src="{{ 'images/tutorials/user-management/admin-menu-visible.png' | asset_url }}" alt="Admin link visible in navigation after login">

Click the link.

You should see a “Not found” page. This is expected, because the `/admin` endpoint does not exist yet. Let’s create it now.

## Create Admin endpoint

Start by creating a new directory for admin pages and adding an index file: `app/views/pages/admin/index.liquid`.
 
Add a simple placeholder message:

#### app/views/pages/admin/index.liquid
``` liquid
“This is a page only admins should see.”
```

After deploying again, the page loads correctly - but any logged-in user can access it. At this stage, the page is not protected by any authorization rules.

<img loading="lazy" src="{{ 'images/tutorials/user-management/admin-page-not-protected.png' | asset_url }}" alt="Admin page unprotected">

This brings us to the next key concept: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in platformOS and how to ensure that only users with the correct permissions can view a specific page.
