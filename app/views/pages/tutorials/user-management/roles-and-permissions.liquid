Up to this point, you have implemented **authentication** in your example application: users can register, sign in, and sign out. Your layout now adapts automatically based on whether someone is logged in.

The next step is **authorization**. This determines *what an authenticated user is allowed to do*. Before we protect the `/admin` page created earlier, we need to understand how platformOS manages permissions.

The User module uses a flexible Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. It is based on three core concepts:

* **Profiles** (each user has one)
* **Roles** (assigned to profiles)
* **Permissions** (bundled inside roles)

## Authentication vs. Authorization

Although the terms are often used together, authentication and authorization solve two very different problems.

### Authentication: *Who are you?*

Authentication verifies identity. When a user signs in, platformOS stores their identity in:

{% raw %} `{{ context.current_user }}` {% endraw %}

This object exists only when a valid session cookie is present. You used it earlier to display dynamic navigation.

### Authorization: *What are you allowed to do?*

Authorization determines whether the authenticated user has permission to perform an action.

This object exists only when a valid session cookie is present. You used it earlier to display dynamic navigation.
The User Module provides helpers such as:

{% raw %}
```liquid
function can = 'modules/user/helpers/can_do', requester: current_profile, do: 'admin.view'
```
{% endraw %}

This command returns `true` or `false` depending on whether the current profile has at least one role that includes the permission `admin.view`.

You will soon use this helper to protect the `/admin` page.

## Built-In Roles (provided by the User Module)

When you install the User Module, several roles already exist:

| **Role**            | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`anonymous`**     | Assigned automatically when no user is logged in. Used to grant access to pages such as `/sessions/new` (login), `/users/new` (registration), and `/passwords/reset` (request reset link). These pages should not require a logged-in session. |
| **`authenticated`** | Assigned to every logged-in user. Useful for pages like a dashboard, profile management, or anything that should only be visible after login.                                                                                                  |
| **`admin`**         | Includes permissions related to administrative management.  |
| **`superadmin`**    | Has full access to everything. This role is typically reserved for high-level operations and should not be modified.                                                                                                                           |


For learning purposes, you will **not** use the built-in `admin` role.
Instead, you’ll create your own custom role so you can see how RBAC works end-to-end.


## Preparing Your Own Permissions Override

The User Module defines default permissions internally. Since module files must **never** be edited directly, your project needs an override.

Create it by copying the permissions file into your `app/` directory:

Run: 

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
mkdir -p app/modules/user/public/lib/queries/role_permissions
cp modules/user/public/lib/queries/role_permissions/permissions.liquid \
   app/modules/user/public/lib/queries/role_permissions/permissions.liquid
</code></pre>

This creates a safe override that allows you to define your own roles and permissions without modifying module files directly.

From this point forward, platformOS will automatically prioritizes your `app` version of the permission file:

```
app/modules/user/.../permissions.liquid   ← your version (active)
modules/user/.../permissions.liquid       ← module version (ignored)
```

{% include 'alert/tutorial', content: 'For additional setup details and configuration options, refer to the <a href="https://github.com/Platform-OS/pos-module-user?tab=readme-ov-file#setup" target="_blank">User Module README</a> on GitHub.' %}

## Understanding the Permissions File

Open the newly copied file. It contains a JSON structure describing each role and its permissions.

#### app/modules/user/public/lib/queries/role_permissions/permissions.liquid

{% raw %}

```liquid
{% parse_json data %}
{
 {% if context.constants.USER_DEFAULT_ROLE != blank %}
 "{{ context.constants.USER_DEFAULT_ROLE }}": [],
 {% endif %}
 "anonymous": ["sessions.create", "users.register"],
 "authenticated": ["sessions.destroy","oauth.manage"],
 "admin": ["admin_pages.view", "admin.users.manage", "users.impersonate"],
 "member": ["profile.manage"],
 "superadmin": ["users.impersonate_superadmin"]
}
{% endparse_json %}

{% return data %}
```
{% endraw %}

Each key is a **role name**, and each value is an array of **permissions**. You can now extend this file with your own custom roles.

You can now extend this file with your own custom roles and permissions.

## Creating a Custom Role

Let’s add a new role to your project. In this tutorial, we will create a simple role named **`manager`**. This role will eventually grant access to your custom admin page.

{% include 'alert/tip', content: 'Always edit the permissions file inside your <code>app/</code> directory. Never modify the version inside <code>modules/</code>, as module updates will overwrite those changes.' %}

### Permission Naming Convention

Permissions follow a naming convention:

```
resource.action
```
<br>

The resource identifies the part of the application being controlled.
The action describes what the role is allowed to do with that resource.

For example:

* `users.register`
* `admin.manage`
* `contacts.list`
* `orders.delete`

You are free to choose the level of granularity. A common and practical guideline is: if a user can create something, they usually need to edit and delete it as well. This is why broader permissions such as `*.manage` appear frequently, while overly fine-grained permissions are less common.

For this tutorial, you only need a single permission: `admin.view`. This will allow the role to access the admin page you created earlier.

Open your overridden permissions file and add a new role:

```json
"manager": ["admin.view"]
```

Your updated file might look like this:

#### app/modules/user/public/lib/queries/role_permissions/permissions.liquid

{% raw %}

```liquid
{% parse_json data %}
{
 {% if context.constants.USER_DEFAULT_ROLE != blank %}
 "{{ context.constants.USER_DEFAULT_ROLE }}": [],
 {% endif %}
 "anonymous": ["sessions.create", "users.register"],
 "authenticated": ["sessions.destroy","oauth.manage"],
 "admin": ["admin_pages.view", "admin.users.manage", "users.impersonate"],
 "member": ["profile.manage"],
 "superadmin": ["users.impersonate_superadmin"],
 "manager": ["admin.view"]
}
{% endparse_json %}

{% return data %}
```
{% endraw %}

This means anyone with the **manager** role is allowed to perform the `admin.view` action. In the next step, you’ll update the page so that only users whose role includes `admin.view` are allowed to open it.
