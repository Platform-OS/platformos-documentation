This guide will help you create an API Call Notification that pings an API endpoint when a new user signs up.

## Requirements
To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should understand the concept of notifications. You'll also use the sign-up form you created in a previous tutorial.

* [Notifications](/tutorials/notifications/notifications)
* [Creating a Sign Up Form](/tutorials/users/creating-sign-up-form)

## Steps

Creating an API Call Notification is a two-step process:

<div data-autosteps></div>

### Step 1: Create API Call Notification

Create an API Call Notification `notifications/api_call_notifications/ping_example_com_on_user_sign_up.liquid`:


```json
{% raw %}
---
name: ping_example_com_on_user_sign_up
to: 'https://example.com/endpoint/{{ form.id }}'
delay: 0
enabled: true
format: http
trigger_condition: true
request_type: POST
headers: '{
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}'
---
{
  "first_name": "{{ form.first_name }}",
  "id": "{{ form.id }}"
}
{% endraw %}
```


This defines a POST request to the endpoint with the newly created user's ID. The response is not stored, it's fire and forget. In this example the body of the request is JSON, and to notify the endpoint about it, you set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.

### Step 2: Connect notification to sign up form

Connect the API Call Notification you created with the sign up form `form_configurations/developer/sign_up.liquid`:


```yaml
---
api_call_notifications:
  - ping_example_com_on_user_sign_up
---
```

Whenever a user successfully sign ups, the `https://example.com/endpoint/{% raw %}{{ form.id }}{% endraw %}` endpoint will be notified.

## Next steps

Congratulations! You have created an API Call Notification. Now you can learn about parsing an API response.
