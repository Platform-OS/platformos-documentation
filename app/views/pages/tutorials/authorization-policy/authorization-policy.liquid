**Authorization Policies** allow you to restrict access to forms and pages in a flexible way. Each form and page can have multiple policies attached to it.

Each policy is parsed using Liquid, and the system checks them in order of their appearance in the `authorization_policies` key.

If the content of the policy evaluates to anything other than `true`, the policy is considered violated and the system will not proceed with executing action (like submitting a form or rendering a page).
