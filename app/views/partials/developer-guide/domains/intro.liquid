## Requirements

To be able to set up a production domain on the Partner Portal, you have to have access to the Partner Portal, have a production Instance, and you should be familiar with the recommended development workflow.

* [Register on the Partner Portal](/get-started/hello-world/hello-world#prerequisite-register-on-the-partner-portal)
* [Create an Instance](/get-started/hello-world/hello-world#step-1-create-an-instance)
* [Development Workflow](/developer-guide/platformos-workflow/development-workflow)

There are a couple things to consider before you add a custom domain to your platformOS production Instance:

1. A domain can only be added on a production data center. This means that you cannot set up an additional domain on a staging data center Instance.
2. PlatformOS Instances require the ability to apply a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) to a DNS record. If your DNS management service does not allow for that, you will need to change providers or opt to use the free fully integrated hosted zone that is provided to you as a benefit of hosting with platformOS. When setting up your custom domain, this is the first decision you must make.
3. We automatically provision and deploy AWS SSL certificates when you add a domain to a platformOS Instance. To apply custom SSL certificates, please contact support@platformOS.com and we will assist further.
