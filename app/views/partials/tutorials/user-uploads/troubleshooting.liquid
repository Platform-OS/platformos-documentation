#### General
* Instead of sending an image to our server you will send a url (returned by S3 response) to the image inside the text field for given image. Image URL should look similar to `https://near-me-oregon-staging.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/uploads%2Fbc50d6da-c17e-477d-b143-c65422c221fd%2Ftest.3+%282%29.png`
* After form submission give our server couple of seconds to pickup your image, generate size versions, process them and upload to the new S3 location so the CDN could pick it up for you and datatabase to be updated with CDN links

If you have problems that you cannot figure out, go to live example page, inspect whats being sent to S3 and our server respectively and find differences between your requests (params, headers, method, form encoding) and those that work - the difference usually is whats broken.

### AWS
* Make sure your form is using POST method
* Make sure your form is sending data as `enctype="multipart/form-data"`
* Do not include any fields that are not listed in the `upload_url_payload` key, otherwise AWS will return error 403 with message `Invalid according to Policy: Extra input fields: xxx`
* Make sure file input is sent last in the form
* Remember to set your file input name to `file`

### Uppy
If you use Uppy and its S3 plugin as we did in this tutorial, you dont have to worry about most of the above.
