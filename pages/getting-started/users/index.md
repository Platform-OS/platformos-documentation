What we call an User, is basically an account, that any of your user can have. We assume that all users have unique emails.

In the next sections we will explain our vision of a user:

* [User profiles](./user-profiles)
* [Sign up forms](./sign-up-forms)
* [How to sign in user that have just created an account](./sign-in-after-sign-up)
* [Authentication](./authentication)
* [Updating user details](./updating-user-details)
* [Displaying user attributes](./displaying-profile)
