We highly recommend using Version Control System. Internally, we use [GitHub](https://github.com) to host our [git](https://git-scm.com/about) repositories. It contains a lot of useful articles. A good starting point would be [how to set up repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/).

However, At the end of the day, you can choose any tools you want, including none. To work with our platform all you need is a project directory, with a subdirectory named `marketplace_builder`.
