This section contains information about a new feature: associating properties directly to a user via `schema.yml`.

## Problem

Currently in order to add a property to a User, you need to go through UserProfile. In simple scenarios, this seems unnecessary and increases the learning curve. For example, if you wanted to add a mandatory property `date_of_birth`, you would need to create a UserProfileType like `Default`, and then write a FormConfiguration similar to:

```yaml
...
resource: User
fields:
  profiles:
    validation: { presence: true }
    default:
      validation: { presence: true }
      properties:
        validation: { presence: true }
        date_of_birth:
          validation: { presence: true }
...
```

It does not look simple, despite being one of the basic use cases.

## Solution

What we would like to introduce is something closer to:

```yaml
...
resource: User
fields:
  properties:
    date_of_birth:
      validation: { presence: true }
```

In order to implement this, we need a place to define `properties` for User in `marketplace_builder`. Hence at the same time, we would like to introduce a new configuration file `schema.yml`. To be able to get most of it, you will also be able to define Custom Model Types and User Profiles in it [hence deprecating the Custom Model Types and User Profile Types directories]. The `schema.yml` could look like this:

```yaml
user:
  profiles:
    seller:
      company_name:
        type: string
  properties:
    date_of_birth:
      type: date

car:
  properties:
    engine:
      type: string
```

Please note, that there are differences between defining properties in `schema.yml` and in `custom_model_types/user_profile_types`. Instead of an array for properties, we will use a hash. It is a better data structure, because we want properties to be unique.
