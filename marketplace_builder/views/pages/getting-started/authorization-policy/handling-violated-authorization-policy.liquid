This guide will help you handle a violated Authorization Policy. 

When an Authorization Policy is violated, the server by default will return an empty page with the `403 Forbidden` status code. You can redirect the user to a different page or display an alert message. 

## Requirements
So that you can follow the steps in this tutorial, you should understand the concept of Authorization Policy. This guide refers to an Authorization Policy created in a previous tutorial (`only_allowed_by_johns`).  

* [Authorization Policy](/get-started/authorization-policy/authorization-policy) 
* [Adding an Authorization Policy](/get-started/authorization-policy/adding-authorization-policy) (previous tutorial)

## Steps 

Handling a violated Authorization Policy is a two-step process:

1. Redirect user to a page
2. Display alert message

### Step 1: Redirect user to a page
To redirect user to a page after violation set the `redirect_to` key. For example, to redirect to page `/login`:

{% raw %}

```yml
---
name: only_allowed_by_johns
redirect_to: /login
---
...
```

{% endraw %}

### Step 2: Display alert message
To generate flash alert message on the page that you defined as `redirect_to`, use the `flash_alert` property:

{% raw %}

```yml
---
name: only_allowed_by_johns
redirect_to: /login
flash_alert: Please login to access this page.
---
...
```

{% endraw %}

As with normal flash messages, you can access it in Liquid using the `{{ context.flash }}` variable.
