This guide will help you remove a Transactable.

_This guide is part of a series that follows a scenario to demonstrate how to manage Transactables, and this tutorial is the last part of the series. You can find the previous part in the Requirements section._

## Requirements
So that you can follow the steps in this tutorial, you should understand the concept of Transactables. You'll also need to follow the series of tutorials about Transactables until the previous tutorial.

* [Transactables](/tutorials/transactables/transactables)
* [Creating the Edit Transactable Page](/get-started/transactables/creating-edit-transactable-page) (previous tutorial)

## Steps

Removing a Transactable is a two-step process:

1. Create Form Configuration to remove Transactable
2. Render form

### Step 1: Create Form Configuration to remove Transactable

```liquid
{% raw %}

name: destroy_project
resource: Transactable
---
{% form method: 'delete' %}
  <input type="submit" value="Delete">
{% endform %}
{% endraw %}
```

### Step 2: Render form

Render this form similarly to the one from the previous tutorial:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% include_form 'destroy_project', resource_id: project.id %}
{% endraw %}
```
