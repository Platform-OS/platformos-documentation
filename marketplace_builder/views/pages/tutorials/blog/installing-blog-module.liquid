This guide will help you install the PlatformOS Blog Module.

_This guide is part of a series that walks you through the process of building a blog on PlatformOS. You can find previous and next parts of the series in the Requirements and Next steps sections._

## Requirements
So that you can follow the steps in this tutorial, you should have set up a PlatformOS Instance and your code base, and you should have NPM and the Marketplace Kit installed on your computer. You should also understand the concept of layouts, modules, and migrations.

* [Get Started](/get-started)
* [Layouts](/tutorials/pages/layouts)
* [Installing Module](/tutorials/modules/installing-module)
* [Migrating Data](/tutorials/migrations/migrating-data)

## Steps

Installing the Blog Module is a three-step process:

1. Install Dashboard Module
2. Register Blog Administrator
3. Setup blog

### Step 1: Install Blog Module

Log in to the [Partner Portal](https://portal.apps.near-me.com/) and go to your Instance detail view.
At the bottom of the page in the Available modules section search for "PlatformOS Blog" and click Install on the right. You will receive an email notification when the installation process is complete.

### Step 2: Create Blog Administrator

A simple administration panel is included in the Blog module, where you can configure your blog and create its content. By default, this part is restricted for registered users with Administrator role.

In order to create your first Admin:

1. Visit your instance page.
2. Go to the signup page by appending `/sign-up` to your instance address in your browser's address bar.
3. Create your first user by sending the form.
4. You will be redirected to the `/log-in` page, where you need to provide the same user login and password.
5. Blog comes with a handy migration which grants Administrator role to all existing users:

```bash
marketplace-kit migrations run staging modules/dashboard/20190102222130
```

Result:

```bash
[Migration Run] Done. modules/dashboard/20190102222130_promote_users_to_admins executed.
```

6. Go to Dashboard page by appending `/dashboard` to your instance address in your browser's address bar.

### Step 3: Setup Blog

On your Dashboard page click on "Blog" in the left side navigation. You will see your Blog navigation, choose "Blog settings" and fill in all the required details. Save your changes.

You can now see your blog at [your-Instance-URL]/blog.

If you want to display your blog content on your home page, define it as follows:

```liquid
---
slug: /
layout_name: modules/dashboard_blog/blog
---
{% raw %}
{% include 'modules/dashboard_blog/blog/index' %}
{% endraw %}
```

The Blog module doesn't define header and footer of your website as these elements are dynamic and specific to the given instance.
You can define your header and footer HTML in `marketplace_builder/views/partials/layouts/header.liquid` and `marketplace_builder/views/partials/layouts/footer.liquid`

## Next steps
Congratulations! You have installed the Blog Module. Now you can write your first blog post:
