* [Twilio API Reference, REST API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api)

## Steps

Integrating SMS service with Twilio using SMS notifications is a three-step process:

1. Create Twilio Account Using Partner Portal
2. Add SMS notification to the form
3. Billing

### Step 1: Create Twilio Account Using Partner Portal

As a first step you need to create Twilio account that will be associated with your instance. To do that, open your instance view in Partner Portal and follow with "Integrations" link on the top.
At the very bottom of Integrations page you will see `Enable Twilio` button. When you click it, and confirm with next "Enable Twilio Integration" button, Partner Portal will create a subaccount in platformOS Twilio account that will be coneccted to your instance. 

At this point you should see the notification: "We're preparing twilio integration. Refresh page in a few minutes."
And everything should be ready within a few seconds.

### Step 2: Add SMS notification to your forms

This process is explained in detailed in [Creating an SMS Notification](/tutorials/notifications/creating-sms-notification)

### Step 3: Billing

Based on the usage recorded in your Twilio account, platfromOS will charge you on the monthly basis and the summary of your Twilio costs will be added to your monthly invoice. Please note that we add 15% commision to all Twilio costs.
