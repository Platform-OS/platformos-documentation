This guide will help you check the Audit Log, a list of commands performed on Instances.

## Requirements
To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should be able to log in to the Partner Portal, and have an Instance you created or have access to.

* [Accessing the Partner Portal](/get-started/accessing-partner-portal)
* [Setting Up a Site on Our Platform](/get-started/setting-up-site)

## Steps

Checking the Audit Log is a two-step process:

1. Check Audit Log
2. Check Action details

### Step 1: Check Audit Log

In the menu on the left, click on `Partners`, and select the Partner whose Audit Log you'd like to see. Click on the `Audit Log` button to display the list of performed Actions (e.g. `Instance::Update`) along with the Actor (email address of the User who performed the Action), a date, and the input.

The Audit Log highlights rows for quick overview of the status of the Action:

* No highlight means that the Action has been completed.
* A yellow highlight means that the Action is in progress.
* A red highlight means that there was an error while performing the Action.

### Step 2: Check Action details

Click on an Action to see its detailed JSON, raw data, and header files.
Check the JSON file for the status (e.g. initialized or success) and the message.

You can copy or save these files by clicking on the `Copy` and `Save` buttons respectively.
