This guide will describe what certain configuration options do.

## Introduction

This is advanced topic. Do not attempt to change any configuration if you don't know what you are doing. Incorrect changes make your instance unusable for users.

On the Partner Portal, go to _Instances_, select your Instance, and click on _Update configuration_ button.

This will present show you Instance configuration in read-only mode in form of a JSON snapshot.

This section is describing _attributes_ part of this JSON.

## Attributes

### enable_sms_and_api_workflow_alerts_on_staging

We do not send real text messages on staging by default.

Because any error with sending real text messages on staging might be more costly than sending emails.

{% include 'alert/important', content: "Using real SMS will affect your billing." %}

Default value: `false`

#### Example

```json
"enable_sms_and_api_workflow_alerts_on_staging": true
```

### include_tag_with_private_scope

By default Liquid variables defined inside a partial leak outside of them, which means, any variable is a global variable.

We received a lot of requests to make it better, so we changed that behavior and introduced [export tag](/api-reference/liquid/platformos-tags#export).

From that point in time all newly created instances have variables scoped to the partials and this flag set to `true`.

Flag was added to keep backwards compatibility of instances that have been written with standard Liquid behavior in mind.

We strongly recommend keeping it `true` and migrating your projects to use private scopes to increase predictability and

Default value: `true`

#### Example

```json
"include_tag_with_private_scope": true
```

### maintenance_mode

This settings redirects all incoming requests to `/maintenance` path on your instance, with HTTP status code `503`.
Page contains message: `Temporarily down for maintenance.`.

{% comment %} TODO: Add information how to customize this page  {% endcomment %}

Default value: `false`

#### Example

```json
"maintenance_mode": true
```

### test_email

By default emails on staging are not going to the email recipient defined inside the email notification, but to email(s) defined in this attribute.

You can enter multiple emails, comma-separated.

Default value: `""`

#### Example

```json
"test_email": "sales@platform-os.com,developer@platform-os.com,support@platform-os.com"
```
