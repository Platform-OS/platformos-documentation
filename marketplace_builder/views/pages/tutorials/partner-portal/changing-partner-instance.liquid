## Steps

Changing the Partner of an Instance is a two-step process:

1. Locate Instance
2. Change Partner

### Step 1: Locate Instance

In the menu on the left, click on `Instances`, then select the name of the Instance you want to change the Partner of. The information page of the Instance is displayed.

### Step 2: Change Partner
You can see the Partner the Instance belongs to under **Partner**. To change the Partner, scroll to `Change Partner`, and select the Partner you would like to assign to the Instance from the drop-down. Once selected, click on `Change`.

The Instance information page reloads, and you can see that the Instance now belongs to the Partner you specified.

## Next steps
