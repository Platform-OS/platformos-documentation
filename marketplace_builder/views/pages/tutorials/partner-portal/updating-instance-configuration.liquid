This guide will help you update the configuration on an Instance.

## Requirements
To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should be able to log in to the Partner Portal, and have an Instance you created or have access to.

* [Accessing the Partner Portal](/get-started/accessing-partner-portal)
* [Setting Up a Site on Our Platform](/get-started/setting-up-site)

## Steps
Updating the configuration of an Instance is a two-step process:

1. Locate Instance
2. Update Instance configuration

### Step 1: Locate Instance

In the menu on the left, click on `Instances`, and select the Instance you would like to update. The information page of the Instance is displayed.

### Step 2: Update Instance configuration

Click on `Update configuration`. You can see the JSON file that stores your configuration information for the Instance, for example, integrations that you have set up. Most of the configuration can be changed through the Partner Portal, but for example, you can configure a test email here.

To update the configuration, edit the JSON file, then click on `Update config`.

## Next steps
Congratulations! You know how to update the configuration of an Instance. Now you can set up a test email or add integrations:
