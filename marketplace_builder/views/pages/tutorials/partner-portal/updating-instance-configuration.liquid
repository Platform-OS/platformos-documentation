### Step 1: Locate Instance

In the menu on the left, click on `Instances`, and select the Instance you would like to update. The information page of the Instance is displayed.

### Step 2: Update Instance configuration

Click on `Update configuration`. You can see the JSON file that stores your configuration information for the Instance, for example, integrations that you have set up. Most of the configuration can be changed through the Partner Portal, but for example, you can configure a test email here.

You are in read-only mode. To modify the JSON configuration file, switch to Edit mode by clicking on `Switch to Edit Mode`. Edit the JSON file, then click on `Update Instance configuration`. 

## Next steps
