This guide will help you find an Instance on the Partner Portal.

The guide shows two ways to find Instances:

* Default: Search for an Instance using the Search field.
* Inactive Instances: Sometimes you won't be able to find an Instance a few minutes after creating it. It happens when an Instance had been successfully created, but failed to be registered in the Partner Portal. These are called Inactive Instances.

## Requirements
To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should be able to log in to the Partner Portal, and have an Instance you created or have access to.

* [Accessing the Partner Portal](/get-started/accessing-partner-portal)
* [Setting Up a Site on Our Platform](/get-started/setting-up-site)

## Steps

Finding an Instance is a two-step process:

1. Search for Instance
2. Check Inactive Instances (optional)

### Step 1: Search for Instance

In the menu on the left, click on `Instances`. You can see a list of all Instances you have access to. In the Search field on the top right, start typing the string you are looking for. The search checks the string you typed in:

* The name of the Instance
* Partner the Instance belongs to
* URL
* Endpoint

The list of Instances changes dynamically to show the Instances that contain the string you typed.

### Step 2: Check Inactive Instances (optional)

Instances belong to Partners, so in the menu on the left, click on `Partners`, and from the list of Partners, click on the `Instances` link of the Partner the Instance belongs to. You can now see a list of all Instances the Partner has access to.

If you can't find the Instance you are looking for in the list, click on `Inactive Instances`. A list of Inactive Instances is displayed showing the status of each Instance (e.g. `Scheduled to activate` or `Fresh`).

If you found the Instance in the Inactive Instances list, you can try to activate it by clicking on the `Retry` button. A message saying `We're retrying to prepare your Instance. Check your email in a few minutes.` is displayed. In a few minutes, switch to `Active Instances`, and you should see the prepared Instance there.
