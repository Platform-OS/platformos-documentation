This guide will help you set up and manage integrations with third-party services like social media or payment service providers.

platformOS can be used with built-in third-party services that we set up, but you can also build your own connection to any external API.

Currently we support the following integrations:

* Social (OAuth)
    * Facebook
    * Google
    * LinkedIn
    * Instagram
    * Twitter
    * Github
* Security
    * reCAPTCHA
* Email
    * SendGrid
* Payments
    * Stripe

We are continuously adding new integrations.

## Requirements
To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should be able to log in to the Partner Portal, and have an Instance you created or have access to.

* [Accessing the Partner Portal](/get-started/accessing-partner-portal)
* [Setting Up a Site on Our Platform](/get-started/setting-up-site)

## Steps
Setting up integrations for an Instance is a two-step process:

1. Locate Instance
2. Set up integration

### Step 1: Locate Instance

In the menu on the left, click on `Instances`, and select the Instance you would like to update. The information page of the Instance is displayed.

### Step 2: Set up integration

Click on `Integrations`, and select the type of integration you would like to add.

For social integrations, add the `Key` and `Secret`, then click on `Update Social integrations` to save your changes.

For reCAPTCHA, you'll need a `Site Key` and a `Secret Key`. Click on `Enable reCAPTCHA Integration` to save your changes.

For SendGrid, you'll need an `Email` and a `Password`. Click on `Enable SendGrid Integration` to save your changes.

For Stripe, you'll need `Test login` and `Test publishable key` for the test mode, and `Live login` and `Live publishable key` for the live mode. You'll also need to select countries and currencies. Click on `Update Stripe Integration` to save your changes.
