This guide will help you share attributes across multiple user profiles.
If your profiles happen to have the same Custom Attributes, you can extract them to a container profile which will group them and could be used in different profiles.

## Requirements
To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should be familiar with users and user profiles. This guide builds on previous tutorials in the **Get Started: Users** section.

* [Users](/tutorials/users/users)

## Steps

Sharing attributes across multiple user profiles is a three-step process:

1. Create profile template
2. Create profiles
3. Use profiles

### Step 1: Create profile template
Create a general employee template. You can define other profiles that will have fields from the `employee` profile and some more.

#### marketplace_builder/user_profile_types/employee.yml
```yaml
name: employee
properties:
  - name: name
    type: string
  - name: email
    type: string
  - name: emergency_contact
    type: string
```

### Step 2: Create profiles

#### marketplace_builder/user_profile_types/software_developer.yml
```yaml
name: software_developer
properties:
  - name: programming_languages
    type: array
```

#### marketplace_builder/user_profile_types/project_manager.yml
```yaml
name: project_manager
properties:
  - name: projects_managed
    type: array
```

### Step 3: Use profiles

An example of using the software developer profile on a sign-up form:

#### marketplace_builder/form_configurations/software_developer_signup.liquid
```yaml
---
name: software_developer_signup
return_to: /software-developer/sign-in
resource: User
configuration:
  profiles:
    validation: { presence: true }
    employee:
      validation: { presence: true }
      properties:
        validation: { presence: true }
        name: { validation: { presence: true } }
        email: { validation: { presence: true } }
        emergency_contact: { validation: { presence: true } }
    software_developer:
      validation: { presence: true }
      properties:
        validation: { presence: true }
        programming_languages:  { validation: { presence: true } }
---
[...]
```

An example of using the project manager profile on a sign-up form:

#### marketplace_builder/form_configurations/project_manager_signup.liquid
```yaml
---
name: project_manager_signup
return_to: /project-manager/sign-in
resource: User
configuration:
  profiles:
    validation: { presence: true }
    employee:
      validation: { presence: true }
      properties:
        validation: { presence: true }
        name: { validation: { presence: true } }
        email: { validation: { presence: true } }
        emergency_contact: { validation: { presence: true } }
    project_manager:
      validation: { presence: true }
      properties:
        validation: { presence: true }
        projects:  { validation: { presence: true } }
---
[...]
```

{% include 'alert/note', content: 'If you would like to create a profile on sign up without assigning any custom attribute, please make sure that params would include at minimum form[profiles_attributes][<my_profile_name>_attributes]. You can achieve it with hidden input and `form_builder` or via `default_payload` json.' %}
{% include 'alert/note', content: 'To discover names that fields should have, explore the `form_builder` variable by printing it on your page.' %}
