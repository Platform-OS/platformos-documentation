A **User** is an account that any of your users can have. Each user is assumed to have a unique email address.

**User Profiles** are roles in the marketplace. Each User Profile can be associated with any number of Custom Attributes, Categories, and Custom Model Types.

## The default User Profile

All users are assigned a User Profile named Default. If you don't want to distinguish one type of user from the other, you don't need to create any other user profiles.

## Sharing attributes across multiple profiles

If your multiple profiles happen to have the same custom attributes, you can extract them to a container profile which will group them and could be used in different profiles.

### Example

A company has a lot of employees, but all of them have the same attributes like name, email, emergency contact, so it would be a good idea to make a default profile for employee, and then use more specific ones for specific roles in the company.

```yaml
Employee: name, email, emergency_contact
  - Software Developer: programming_languages
  - Project Manager: projects
```

## Sign up forms

**Sign up forms** allow users to sign up by entering their information in a form embedded in a page.

All forms should be located in the `marketplace_builder/form_configurations` directory.

## User authentication

There are a couple of ways to authenticate a user in PlatformOS,  the most common being through an email and password pair, which the user provided via a sign up form.
