This guide will help you create an authentication form to log out authenticated users.

## Requirements

To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should be familiar with the required directory structure for your code base, and understand the concept of pages and users.

* [Required Directory Structure](/how-platformos-works/platformos-workflow)
* [Pages](/tutorials/pages/pages)
* [Users](/tutorials/users/users)

## Steps

Logging out an authenticated user is a two-step process:

1. Create log out form
2. Embed the log out form

### Step 1: Create log out form

#### marketplace_builder/form_configurations/log_out.liquid

```liquid
{% raw %}
---
name: log_out
resource: Session
---

{% form method: 'delete' %}
  <button>Log Out</button>
{% endform %}
{% endraw %}
```

The difference from logging in, is that you want to destroy the session. You have to send a DELETE request by providing the `method: delete` attribute to the `form` tag.

### Step 2: Embed the log out form

#### marketplace_builder/views/pages/log-out.liquid

```liquid
{% raw %}
---
slug: log-out
---
<h2>Log out</h2>
{% include_form 'log_out' %}
{% endraw %}
```

## Next steps
Congratulations! You created a log out for authenticated users. Now you can learn about resetting a user's password:
