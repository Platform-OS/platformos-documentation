This guide will help you embed a sign up form in a page.

## Requirements

To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should be familiar with the required directory structure for your codebase, and understand the concept of pages. You'll use the sign up forms created in a previous tutorial.

* [Codebase](/how-platformos-works/platformos-workflow)
* [Pages](/tutorials/pages/pages)
* [Creating a Sign Up Form](/tutorials/users/creating-sign-up-form) (previous tutorial)

## Steps

Embedding a sign up form is a two-step process:

<div data-autosteps></div>

### Step 1: Create page

Create a new page in the  `marketplace_builder/views/pages/developer` directory named `sign-up.liquid`, and another page in the `views/pages/client` directory named `sign-up.liquid`.

### Step 2: Embed form

Add `{% raw %}{% include_form 'developer_sign_up' %}{% endraw %}` to embed the previously created sign up forms into the sign up pages.

#### marketplace_builder/views/pages/developer/sign-up.liquid

```liquid
{% raw %}
---
slug: developer/sign-up
---
<h1>Create a Developer Account</h1>

{% include_form 'developer_sign_up' %}
{% endraw %}
```

This will display the form you created previously at https://[your-domain]/developer/sign-up.

#### marketplace_builder/views/pages/client/sign-up.liquid

```liquid
{% raw %}
---
slug: client/sign-up
---
<h1>Create a Client Account</h1>

{% include_form 'client_sign_up' %}
{% endraw %}
```

This will display the form you created previously at https://[your-domain]/client/sign-up.
