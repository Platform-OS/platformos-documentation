**Flash messages** are used to create notices and alerts, e.g. on form submission.

## Setting form notice/alert values through FormConfiguration

You can add values for `flash` messages as part of form configuration, for example:

```yaml
---
name: signup_form
resource: User
configuration:
  email:
  password:
flash_notice: You have successfully signed up
flash_alert: Please fix validation errors
---
```

### Interpolation

Values for `flash` keys are processed using a Liquid parser, so they can be interpolated in the context of the current form:

```yaml
---
name: signup_form
resource: User
configuration:
  email:
  password:
  first_name:
    validation: { presence: true }
flash_notice: 'Thank you {% raw %}{{ form.first_name }}{% endraw %}, you have successfully signed up!'
flash_alert: Please fix validation errors
---
```

{% include 'alert/note', content: 'Quotes around the value of flash_notice are required if you interpolate Liquid code inside YAML' %}
