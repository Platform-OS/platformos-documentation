**Validations** are used to ensure that only valid data is saved into your database.
This reference shows you how to validate the state of objects before they go into the database using Form Configuration's validations feature.

After reading this reference, you will know:

* How to configure form validation
* How to render validation errors

## Example

Simple validation example:

```yaml
configuration:
  properties:
    title:
      validation:
        presence: true
```

A form with the above configuration will not be valid without title property passed with the request unless it's already set on the object passed to the form.

## Validation types

You can use the following validation types:

### presence
```yaml
title:
  validation:
    presence: true
```
### unique
```yaml
configuration:
  properties:
    slug:
      validation:
        presence: true
        unique:
          scope:
            - other_property
          message: Must be uniq
```
### confirmation
```yaml
email:
  validation:
    confirmation: true
```
### inclusion / exclusion
```yaml
   malpractice_history:
      validation:
        inclusion:
          in: [true, false]
          message: disclosure is required
```

### format
```yaml
phone:
  validation:
    presence: true
    format:
      with: !ruby/regexp /\A[+]?[\d \-()]+\z/
      allow_blank: true
      message: This seems to be an invalid phone number. Please try using numbers only
```

### file_content_type
```yaml
file:
  validation:
    presence: true
    file_content_type:
      allow:
      - image/jpeg
      - image/png
      - application/pdf
      - application/msword
      - application/vnd.ms-excel
```

### length
```yaml
attachments:
  validation:
    length:
      is: 2
      message: You need to include Front side and Back side Photo ID
```

The possible length constraint options are:

* minimum - The attribute cannot have less than the specified length.
* maximum - The attribute cannot have more than the specified length.
* in (or within) - The attribute length must be included in a given interval. The value for this option must be a range.
* is - The attribute length must be equal to the given value.

### numericality

```yaml
rate_amount:
  validation:
    presence: true
    numericality:
      greater_than_or_equal_to: 0
```
Available options are:

* only_integer
* greater_than - Specifies that the value must be greater than the supplied value. The default error message for this option is "must be greater than %{count}".
* greater_than_or_equal_to - Specifies that the value must be greater than or equal to the supplied value. The default error message for this option is "must be greater than or equal to %{count}".
* equal_to - Specifies that the value must be equal to the supplied value. The default error message for this option is "must be equal to %{count}".
* less_than - Specifies that the value must be less than the supplied value. The default error message for this option is "must be less than %{count}".
* less_than_or_equal_to - Specifies that the value must be less than or equal to the supplied value. The default error message for this option is "must be less than or equal to %{count}".
* other_than - Specifies that the value must be other than the supplied value. The default error message for this option is "must be other than %{count}".
* odd - Specifies that the value must be an odd number if set to true. The default error message for this option is "must be odd".
* even - Specifies that the value must be an even number if set to true. The default error message for this option is "must be even".

## Conditional Validation

It is possible to validate attributes based on the state of other attributes from the form.
{% raw %}
```yaml
expiry_year:
  validation:
    presence:
      if: '{% if form.expires %}true{% endif %}'
```
{% endraw %}

## Common Validation Options

### message
It is possible to overwrite the default message with additional configuration:

```yaml
customizations:
  expertise:
    validation:
      presence:
        message: record is required.
```

### allow_nil
The `allow_nil` option skips the validation when the value being validated is nil.

### allow_blank
Allows to pass an empty string.

### Validation Errors

When form validation is raised, error message is added to `form_builder.errors` object that contains errors corresponding to fields.

If you need errors for particular field, access them through:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{{ form_object.errors.<field_name> }}
{% endraw %}
```

Example:
```liquid
{% raw %}
{{ form_object.errors.name }}
{% endraw %}
```

### Translation

Each error message can be translated with the PlatformOS transalation mechanism.
The default error messages are:
```yaml
en:
  errors:
    # The default format to use in full error messages.
    format: "%{attribute} %{message}"
    # The values :model, :attribute and :value are always available for interpolation
    # The value :count is available when applicable. Can be used for pluralization.
    messages:
      model_invalid: "Validation failed: %{errors}"
      inclusion: "is not included in the list"
      exclusion: "is reserved"
      invalid: "is invalid"
      confirmation: "doesn't match %{attribute}"
      accepted: "must be accepted"
      empty: "can't be empty"
      blank: "can't be blank"
      present: "must be blank"
      too_long:
        one: "is too long (maximum is 1 character)"
        other: "is too long (maximum is %{count} characters)"
      too_short:
        one: "is too short (minimum is 1 character)"
        other: "is too short (minimum is %{count} characters)"
      wrong_length:
        one: "is the wrong length (should be 1 character)"
        other: "is the wrong length (should be %{count} characters)"
      not_a_number: "is not a number"
      not_an_integer: "must be an integer"
      greater_than: "must be greater than %{count}"
      greater_than_or_equal_to: "must be greater than or equal to %{count}"
      equal_to: "must be equal to %{count}"
      less_than: "must be less than %{count}"
      less_than_or_equal_to: "must be less than or equal to %{count}"
      other_than: "must be other than %{count}"
      odd: "must be odd"
      even: "must be even"
```
