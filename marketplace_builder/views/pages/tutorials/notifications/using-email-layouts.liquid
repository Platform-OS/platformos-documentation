This guide will help you provide a layout for your email notifications.

## Requirements
As the concept of an email layout is the same as the concept of a layout for pages, you should understand the concepts of layouts and notifications, and should have created an email notification before.

* [Layouts](/tutorials/pages/layouts)
* [Notifications](/tutorials/notifications/notifications)
* [Creating an Email Notification](/tutorials/notifications/creating-email-notification)

## Steps

Using email layouts is a two-step process:

1. Create email layout file
2. Edit email layout file

### Step 1: Create email layout file

The default layout file for all emails should be located in the `views/layouts` directory. Create a file named `mailer.html.liquid`.

### Step 2: Edit email layout file

The content of an email layout is slightly different from the content of a layout for pages, because it needs to be marked as an email layout.

Add the following to your email layout file `mailer.html.liquid`:


```liquid
{% raw %}
  Header

  {{ content_for_layout }}

  Footer
{% endraw %}
```


Where {% raw %}`{{ content_for_layout }}`{% endraw %} injects the body defined in the email notification into the layout. Without it, you would be sending a layout without actual content.
