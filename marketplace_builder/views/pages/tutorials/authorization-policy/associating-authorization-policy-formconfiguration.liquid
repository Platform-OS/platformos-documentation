This guide will help you associate an Authorization Policy with Form Configuration.

## Requirements
So that you can follow the steps in this tutorial, you should understand the concept of Authorization Policy, and you should have created an Authorization Policy.

* [Authorization Policy](/tutorials/authorization-policy/authorization-policy)
* [Adding an Authorization Policy](/tutorials/authorization-policy/adding-authorization-policy)

## Steps

Associating an Authorization Policy with Form Configuration is a two-step process:

1. Create Form Configuration
2. Add `authorization_policies` key to Form Configuration

### Step 1: Create Form Configuration
Assuming you have a simple form that allows to change the user's last name, the configuration file can look like this:

```yaml
---
name: update_last_name
resource: User
configuration:
  last_name:
    validation:
      presence: {}
---
...
```

### Step 2: Add `authorization_policies` key to Form Configuration
In order to associate the Authorization Policy with the form, add a new `authorization_policies` key, and then specify the array of policy names associated with this form.

To ensure that only Johns will be able to submit this form, update the configuration to include the policy:

```yaml
---
name: update_last_name
resource: User
authorization_policies:
  - only_allowed_by_johns
...
```
