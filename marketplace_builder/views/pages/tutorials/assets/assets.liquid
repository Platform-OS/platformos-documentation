**Assets** are files that can be served by an http web server without any backend/server processing. They are usually Javascript files, stylesheets (CSS), documents (html, pdf, doc), fonts, or media (audio, video) files.

## Assets directory

The directory for assets is: `marketplace_builder/assets`

In order to correctly communicate with the PlatformOS engine and API, your code base should be organized into a specific directory structure. The root directory of your project should contain the `marketplace_builder` directory, and assets should be placed into the `assets` directory inside `marketplace_builder`.

Although only the `assets` directory is required and you can put your assets there, we recommend you further organize your assets into subdirectories inside the `assets` directory, e.g. `images`, `scripts` for Javascript files, `styles` for CSS files, etc. This is also how the `marketplace-kit init` command will create the required directory structure.

## Content Delivery Network

Assets are uploaded to a Content Delivery Network (CDN). The directory structure on the CDN corresponds to the required directory structure of your code base, except for the beginning of the URL.

**Example**

Location of image asset in code base:
`marketplace_builder/assets/images/logo.svg`

URL of image asset on CDN:
`https://dmtyylqvwgyxw.cloudfront.net/instances/163/assets/images/logo.svg`

{% include 'alert/note', content: 'CDN host and Instance ID are dynamic and will be specific to your instance and region' %}

## Accessing assets

You can access assets through their relative path on the CDN, or with the `asset_url` filter.

**Examples**

Accessing an image from a CSS file located at `assets/styles/page.css`:

```css
background: transparent url('../images/logo.svg') top center no-repeat;
```

Accessing a Javascript file from a layout:

```html
{% raw %}
<script src="{{ 'scripts/app.js' | asset_url }}"></script>
{% endraw %}
```

Accessing a CSS file from a layout:

```html
{% raw %}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ 'styles/app.css' | asset_url }}">
{% endraw %}
```

Accessing an HTML file from a page:

```html
{% raw %}
<a href="{{ 'test.html' | asset_url }}">Test</a>
{% endraw %}
```

## Syncing and deploying assets

Syncing and deploying without force mode only add files on the CDN, and all the added assets will stay in the database even if you delete them on your computer.

To remove files from the database that you deleted on your computer, use deploy. See [Deploying and Syncing Changes](/get-started/deploying-syncing-changes).
