This guide will help you use migrations when you need to change the data or execute a piece of code outside of the regular application running cycle, for example, when you want to seed data on each environment.

## Requirements

This is an advanced tutorial. To follow it, you should be familiar with basic platformOS concepts, and the topics in the Get Started section.

* [How platformOS Works](/how-platformos-works)
* [Get Started](/get-started)

## Steps

Migrating data is a three-step process:

1. Generate empty migration
2. Implement migration
3. Run migration

### Step 1: Generate empty migration
Generate an empty migration using the `marketplace-kit migrations` command:

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
marketplace-kit migrations generate ENVIRONMENT MIGRATION_NAME
</code></pre>

For example:
<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
marketplace-kit migrations generate local add_some_books
</code></pre>

On success, this generates an empty migration in the `marketplace_builder/migrations` directory.

Please note that the name you provide will be prefixed with a UTC timestamp, that looks like this: `20180731120002`. In our example, the file created will be named something like this: `20180909123423_add_some_books.liquid`.
This value is used to keep the migrations in order in all environments.

### Step 2: Implement migration
Use the Liquid markup in migration files, that includes executing GraphQL mutations (execute_query tag). A migration file can be synced many times.

For example, the following mutation can be put into the file created by the command in step 1:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% execute_query 'create_book', name: "Animal Farm", author: "George Orwell" %}
{% endraw %}
```

{% include 'alert/note', content: 'Be careful about using deploys with migrations that are not ready, because  deployment runs all migrations that are in pending status.' %}

### Step 3: Run migration

Deployment will try to run migrations one by one (ordered by timestamp) and it will fail if one of the migrations fails.

The `marketplace-kit migrations run` command runs a single migration:

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
marketplace-kit migrations run ENVIRONMENT MIGRATION_TIMESTAMP
</code></pre>

For example:
<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
marketplace-kit migrations run local 20180909123423
</code></pre>

{% include 'alert/note', content: 'For the command, you have to provide the timestamp, not the full name, for example: 20180731120002' %}

A newly created migration is in pending status for as long as it has not been run. Once it's executed (either through a deploy or using the `migrations run` command) it progresses to either done (on success) or error status.

Once migration is in done status it can't be run any more - this makes it safer to run the same queue of migrations on all environments.

When an error occurs, the migration can be edited and rerun until it succeeds.
