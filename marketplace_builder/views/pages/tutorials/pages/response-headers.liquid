**Response Headers** is a property to define your own custom response headers for the page. To do so, pass a JSON key-value pairs to `response_headers` property, for example:

### views/pages/xml-data.html.liquid

```yaml
slug: xml-data
response_headers: >
  {
    "Content-Type": "text/xml",
    "Some-Header": "value"
  }
```

In example above, endpoint `/xml-data` will return it's content as XML, even though file was saved as `html` format. This allows you to have a full control over returned headers. Liquid syntax is supported.

There are few restricted header names that cannot be overwritten:

  * `cache-control`
  * `etag`
  * `set-cookie`
  * `x-request-id`
  * `x-xss-protection`
