This guide will help you inject dynamic content from a page into a layout using the `content_for` and `yield` tags. This is often used when setting metadata for a particular page (i.e. title tag contents), loading per-page javascript, or per-page stylesheet.

## Requirements
To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should have created a page and a layout.

* [Creating a Page](/get-started/creating-page)
* [Creating a Layout](/get-started/creating-layout)

## Steps

Injecting dynamic content into a layout is a two-step process:

1. Use `yield` in layout
2. Use `content_for` in page

### Step 1: Use `yield` in layout

Add the yield tag to the previously created `application.liquid` layout file, e.g. switch the layout title to dynamic content with the `yield` tag:

```liquid
{% raw %}
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <title>{% yield 'meta_title' %}</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Layout</h1>
    {{ content_for_layout }}
  </body>
</html>
{% endraw %}
```

### Step 2: Use `content_for` in page

Add the `content_for` tag in the previously created `home.liquid` page. The positioning of this line doesn't matter as long as it's in the content part of the page.

```liquid
{% raw %}
---
slug: /
---

{% content_for 'meta_title' %}Homepage title{% endcontent_for %}
Homepage
{% endraw %}
```

Sync or deploy. You can now see that the Homepage title is displayed in your browser's title bar or tab.

Add `content_for` to all pages in the same way, and the page title will be dynamically displayed for each page.

## Next steps
Congratulations! You have injected dynamic content into a layout. Now you can learn how to reuse code across multiple pages using partials.
