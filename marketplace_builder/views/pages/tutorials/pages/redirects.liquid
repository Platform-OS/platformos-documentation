**Redirects** are used to redirect one page to another using an HTTP status code.

## Example

Redirecting /my-page to /other-page using the 302 status:

```yaml
---
slug: my-page
redirect_to: /other-page
redirect_code: 302
---
```

## Example 2

Usage params from GET request inside the `redirect_to` option to make SEO friendly redirects from one URL pattern to another.

Redirecting `/cars?maker=honda` to `/category/cars/honda` using the 301 status:

```yaml
{% raw %}
---
slug: cars
redirect_to: '/category/cars/{{ params.maker }}'
redirect_code: 301
---
{% endraw %}
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `slug` | defines the URL at which this page will be accessible. In this example, assuming your site's domain is `https://example.com`, you will be able to access the page at `https://example.com/my-page`
| `redirect_to` | endpoint which you want the user to be redirected to
| `redirect_code` | specifies the status of redirection. Can be either 301 (Moved Permanently) or 302 (Found)
