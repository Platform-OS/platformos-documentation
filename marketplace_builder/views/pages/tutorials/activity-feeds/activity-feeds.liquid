An **activity** is a semantic description of an action.

Get familiar with the [W3C Recommendation for Activity Streams 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-activitystreams-core-20170523/). Most examples and part of the implementation you'll find in this guide are based on this specification, that provides a JSON-based syntax that is sufficient to express metadata about activities in a rich, human-friendly but machine-processable and extensible manner. This can include constructing natural-language descriptions or visual representations about the activity, associating actionable information with various types of objects, communicating or recording activity logs, or delegation of potential actions to other applications.

## Activities
After each specified action, you have to create an activity and then publish the activity UUID to specific feeds.

### Example

#### Sample scenario
A user joins a private group by sending a membership request to the group moderator. Later the moderator reviews and accepts the user's request. The user becomes a group member.

#### Actions and activities
In this scenario you can distinguish 3 actions:

1. User requests group membership
2. Group moderator accepts user's request
3. User joins the group

For each action, you can create an activity as follows:

|    | actor     | type    | object       | target |
|----|-----------|---------|--------------|--------|
| 1. | user      | create  | relationship | group  |
| 2. | moderator | approve | relationship | group  |
| 3. | user      | join    | group        |        |


#### Sample code

```json
{
	"actor": {
		"type": "Person",
		"id": "User.1",
		"name": "Sally Smith"
	},
	"type": "Join",
	"object": {
		"type": "Group",
		"id": "Customization.1",
		"name": "SuperGroup"
	}
}
```

## Activity feeds

You can define multiple different activity feeds.

* Private feed: your FB main page for example is your private feed - your friends' activities are posted there
* Public feed: there is also a public feed - where your friends may see your activities

You can specify the following activity feed types:

| feed type          | visibility | purpose                                  |
|--------------------|------------|------------------------------------------|
| user-notifications | private    | notifications that only the user can see |
| user-activities    | public     | user's public activities                 |
| group-activities   | public     | all group related public activities      |

In the example scenario, the activity distribution could be like this:

| activity                                | feeds                          |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| user-create-relationship-to-group       | moderator's user-notifications |
| moderator-approve-relationship-to-group | user's user-notifications      |
| user-join-group                         | user's group activities        |
|                                         | group's group-activities       |
