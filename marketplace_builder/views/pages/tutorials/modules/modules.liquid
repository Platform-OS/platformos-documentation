**Modules** allow code reuse and sharing, while protecting the IP of creators.

## Directory structure

Module code is split into 2 directories to protect IP. To create a module, split module code into `public` and `private` folders, and place all that code into the `modules/MODULE_NAME` directory.

```shell
modules
└── MODULE_NAME
    ├── public
    └── private
```

These directories have the same structure as the standard `marketplace_builder` folder, but if developers try to download files after the module has been deployed to an Instance (`marketplace-kit pull`), they will only see the files from the public folder.

You can create an Instance and deploy the code as you would usually do, and you still can have the `marketplace_builder` folder on the top level (this code will not be part of the module but you can use it while developing).

This mechanism allows creators to share their module code, make it configurable (by code in the `public` folder), but still protect the IP in the `private` folder.

### Example: Module directories

An example of module code split into two directories, inside the `modules` directory:

```shell
admincms
├── private
│   └── graph_queries
│       ├── get_customizations.graphql
│       └── get_pages.graphql
└── public
    └── views
        └── pages
            └── admin.liquid
```


## Resource naming conventions and paths

Configuration files placed in a module are treated a bit differently than regular files.
To avoid conflicts between the code of a module and regular code (or between modules) a namspacing strategy is used.

##### Namspacing rules

1. assets (JavaScript, CSS, images) - paths for those files are prefixed with *modules/MODULE_NAME*

For example if you have asset in a file called 'app.css' in a module named "admin" to include it you should use

```liquid
 <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="{{ 'modules/admin/app.css' | asset_url }}">
```

 The same thing works for JavaScript files, for example:

```liquid
<script src="{{ 'modules/admin/admin.js' | asset_url }}"></script>
```

2. Partials

Partials can use full path with the prefix this is a bit longer but allows us to avoid ambiguity

```liquid
{%- include 'modules/blog/private/views/partials/comments' -%}
```

3. Layouts

Layouts have the same prefix so when you use them you should do it in the following way

```liquid
slug: 'admin/settings'
format: html
layout_name: modules/admin/views/layouts/settings
```

4. Other resources (Authorization Policy, Graph Query, etc.)

When creating a module you don't have to add prefix to the name but when you use it (inside or outside of module scope) you have to provide
the 'module_name/' prefix. Some examples:

```liquid
{% comment %} Definition stays the same {% endcomment %}
---
name: can_view_blog_posts
redirect_to: 'blog'
flash_alert: 'Please log in to access this page.'
---
{% query_graph "blog/get_blog_user", result_name: g %}
{% comment %}
 if g.current_user and g.current_user.admin_profile true endif
{% endcomment %}
true

{% comment %} But is used with a prefix {% endcomment %}
authorization_policies:
  - 'blog/can_view_blog_posts'
```

```liquid
{% comment %} Query stays the same {% endcomment %}

query get_blog_instance(
  $current_user_id: ID
  $slug: String
  $scope: String
) {
  customizations(
  ...
) {
}

{% comment %} But you use it with the module prefix {% endcomment %}
{%- query_graph 'blog/get_blog_instance', scope: 'blog', result_name: 'bi', slug: url_params.slug -%}
```
