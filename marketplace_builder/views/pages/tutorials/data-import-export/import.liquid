This topic describes **data import** from the new stack.

Data to be imported needs to be in JSON format:

```json
{
  "users": [...],
  "models": [...],
  "transactables": [...]
}
```

You can generate data from an existing Instance with the `marketplace-kit data export` command ([read more about this here](/tutorials/data-import-export/export#cli-export)). It will generate the `data.json` file. You can also import data from other sources (e.g. old stack, other systems) once you generate the proper JSON file. It is fairly easy to convert, for example, a CSV file into a JSON file.

## General information

Before import, your model schemas need to be deployed.

When importing data, the `id` fields will be changed. Relations will be kept. If you have your own relations defined in properties, you need to first describe them in model schema files - [read more about this here](/tutorials/data-import-export/model-relations).

If you test your imports and need to clean Instance data, use the `marketplace-kit data clean` command. Note, that this command will work only on staging Instances.

When you run import twice, it will try to match previously imported data without removing existing changes. Lets see example:
1. We do have model `shirt` with properties: `color`, `size`
2. First import adds new `shirt` with JSON: `{ "id": 1, "properties": { "color": "red" }}`
3. User set attributes of `shirt`, now `shirt` has those properties: `{ "color": "green", "size": "large" }`
4. Second import with the same file changes `shirt` object to: `{ "color": "red", "size": "large" }`


Import will do only basic validations, such us email uniqueness on users, existence of properties, and type validation. It doesn't check any of the validations defined on forms.

## Data Import with CLI

With marketplace-kit data, you can export/import Instance data (information entered by the users).


platformOS CLI provides the `marketplace-kit data import` command for uploading and importing data from a JSON file. It accepts one option:

- --path (short: -p): A path to a JSON data file to be imported

Under the hood, the CLI uses the GraphQL import API that's described in the next section. However, using the CLI provides some major benefits:

- Uploading file from disk
- Leveraging the CLI's authentication mechanism (i.e. you don't need to manually send your authentication token)

### Input format

The required data format is a JSON file with users, models, and Transactable keys that have an array of maps. Each of those collections needs to be in the same format as a corresponding GraphQL mutation. Under the hood import is just a set of mutations: `import_users()`, `import_models()`, `import_transactables()`. When importing data using the CLI, the file should contain data in a format that matches the following structure:

```json
{
  "users": [<UserImport],
  "models": [<CustomizationImport>],
  "transactables": [<TransactableImport>]
}
```

### Example

To import the data from a file, simply run the following command in the terminal:

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
marketplace-kit data import --path=data.json staging-instance
</code></pre>

## Data Import with GraphQL mutations

It is possible to import data using GraphQL mutations. This gives you more flexibility, and even allows you to create your own import tool as a website feature. Please remember to handle authentication properly.

There are three main mutations for importing [import_users](), [import_models]() and [import_transactables](). You can create a page that will import sent data.

```graphql
mutation import_data(
    $users: [UserImport!]!,
    $transactables: [TransactableImport!]!,
    $models: [CustomizationImport!]!
  ) {
  import_users(users: $users) { ids }
  import_transactables(transactables: $transactables) { ids }
  import_models(models: $models) { ids }
}
```

  -X POST https://example.com/import_data.json
</code></pre>

## Data Import with raw import API

Our CLI uses the HTTP API to import a data file. You can use it in your own tool.
Please note, that you need to provide your authentication token in the HTTP Authorization header of the request.

<pre class="command-line" data-output="2-6" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
curl -d @data.json \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Token token=[YOUR API TOKEN]" \
  -X POST https://example.com/api/marketplace_builder/imports
</code></pre>
