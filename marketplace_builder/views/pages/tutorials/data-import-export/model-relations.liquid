With `properties`, you can create your custom fields for storing the data. In the properties, you can also store the `id` of an existing object. Then you can fetch the data with `model(join_on_property: String!)` or the `user(join_on_property: String!)` field in GraphQL.

In order to export/import data with relations preserved, you need to define them in model schema files using the `belongs_to` attribute.

```yaml
#### marketplace_builder/custom_model_types/house.yaml
name: house
properties:
- name: address
  type: string
```

```yaml
#### marketplace_builder/custom_model_types/cars.yaml
name: cars
properties:
- name: color
  type: string
- name: house_id
  type: integer
  belongs_to: house
```
