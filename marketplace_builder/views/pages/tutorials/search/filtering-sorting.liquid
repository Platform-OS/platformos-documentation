Filtering using Elasticsearch is a slightly different operation from [Search](/tutorials/search/search), but they are easy to confuse. This topic explains filtering and sorting using GraphQL queries. 

## Filtering

To filter items by exact value use

* `user:` for `people`

```graphql
people(user: {first_name: "darek"}) {
  results {
    email
  }
}
```


* `listing` for `listings`

```graphql
listings(listing: {slug: "transactable-slug"}){
  results {
    slug
  }
}
``` 

Please note, that there is no filter argument in the customizations entry point. You specify filtering operations directly. 

```graphql
{
  customizations(
    page: 1 per_page: 210
    properties: [
      { name: "name", value: "alpha|beta" }
    ]
    name: "company"
  ) {
    total_entries
    results {
      id
      name
      properties
    }
  }
}
```

## Sorting

Use `sort` to change your the ordering of your collection. 
When sorting automatically, the `raw` field is used. 

```graphql
{
  customizations(
    page: 1 per_page: 210
    sort: [
      { name: "properties.url", order: "ASC" }
      { name: "properties.name" order: "DESC" }
    ]  	
    name: "company"
  ) {
    total_entries
    results {
      id
      name
      url property(name: "url")
      name property(name: "name")
    }
  }
}
```
