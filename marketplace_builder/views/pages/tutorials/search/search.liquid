**Search** functionality in PlatformOS is implemented with GraphQL queries.

Search is usually more complex, than other GraphQL queries because of the many additional filters that you can choose from. You can build search for any object supported in GraphQL-most common choices are Users and Transactables.

## Keyword search

By default keyword search is looking in all fields that are provided to the database.

In your GraphQL query, you can decide which fields keyword search should search in.

If you leave the keyword field empty, it means you are looking for everything, so narrowing by field names will not be applied.

Learn more about narrowing keyword search in our [Search Reference Documentation](/tutorials/search/narrowing-keyword-search).

## Keyword match type

Search by default tries to match the keyword exactly with the words in the field. When you search for `alan` it will match values `alan` but also `Mike Alan` and `Mike Alan and Tommy`. You can also define keyword to match words that start or end with the specified phrase.

Learn more about keyword match type in our [Search Reference Documentation](/tutorials/search/keyword-match-type).
