This guide will help you give Instance permissions to users of the Partner Portal. Permissions include:

* Being allowed to create new Instances 
* Having read, write, or write and deploy access to different Instances 

## Requirements
To be able to set up Instance permissions for users on the Partner Portal, you have to have access to the Partner Portal, and the users you would like to give permissions to.

* [Accessing the Partner Portal](/get-started/setup/accessing-partner-portal)
* [Inviting a New User to the Partner Portal](/get-started/partner-portal/inviting-new-user-to-partner-portal)

## Steps

Setting up Instance permissions is a two-step process:

1. Grant permission to create new Instances
2. Grant permissions to access Instances

### Step 1: Grant permission to create new Instances

Log in to our [Partner Portal](https://portal.apps.near-me.com). In the [list of users](https://portal.apps.near-me.com/users), select the user by clicking on its email address.

On the selected user's page, click on `Manage permissions`, then select the `Manage Instances` tab. If the user doesn't have permission to create new Instances, you can grant permission by clicking on `Grant` under `Grant permission to create new Instances`. 

If the user has permission to create new Instances, you can revoke this permission, by clicking on `Revoke` under `Revoke permission to create new Instances`. 

### Step 2: Grant permissions to access Instances

To grant permissions to access Instances, select access level (`Read`, `Write`, or `Write and deploy`):
* `Read`: The user can see the Instance, but can't modify it. 
* `Write`: The user can see and modify the Instance, but can't deploy. E.g. the user can change configuration, but can't make changes in the codebase and deploy them.  
* `Write and deploy`: The user can see, modify, and deploy to the Instance. 

Select the Instances you would like to give the user access to by checking their checkboxes in the drop-down menu.

Once you've selected the permissions, click on `Submit`.

You can check the user's permissions anytime under `This user has access to following instances` on the `Instances` tab. 

{% include "alert/note", content: "Granting permissions to Partners and Instances are completely separate: If you grant permissions to an Instance, the user won't automatically get access to the Partner of that Instance. You have to set this up separately as explained in the tutorial linked below." %}

## Next steps
Congratulations! You have set up a user's Instance permissions on our Partner Portal. Now, you may want to set up Partner permissions.
