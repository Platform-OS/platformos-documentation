This guide will help you request and set up an SSL Certificate for your domain. 

## Requirements
To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should be able to log in to our Partner Portal, have an Instance you created or have access to, and have a domain associated with the Instance. 

* [Accessing our Partner Portal](/get-started/setup/accessing-partner-portal)
* [Setting Up a Site on Our Platform](/get-started/setup/setting-up-site)
* [Adding a Domain to an Instance](/get-started/partner-portal/adding-domain-instance)

## Steps

Setting up SSL for a domain is a three-step process:

1. Locate domain
2. Request SSL Certificate 
3. Install certificate into Load Balancer

### Step 1: Locate domain
In the menu on the left, click on `Instances`, and select the Instance you would like to add a domain to. You can also [find an Instance through Search](/get-started/partner-portal/finding-instances). The information page of the Instance is displayed.

Click the `DNS & SSL` button. You can see DNS information, and a list of domains associated with the Instance. Locate the domain you would like to request an SSL Certificate for. 

### Step 2: Request SSL Certificate
Click on the `request SSL cert` button. A form is displayed, pre-populated with default values according to the selected domain:

* `Domain name`: name of the selected domain
* `Subject alternative names`: Add up to 10 domain names to this text area, one domain per line. 
* `Validation method`: Your SSL Certificate can be validated in two ways:
    * `DNS`: Add CNAME DNS record to your domain configuration.
    * `EMAIL`: Receive an email with a validation link.

Click on `Request Certificate`. We start the process of requesting your certificate. You can check the status of this process on the Certificate details page displayed. 

It can take 30 minutes or longer for the changes to propagate, and for AWS to validate the domain and issue the certificate.

Click on `Refresh` to display the instructions for using the SSL Certificate. The instructions correspond to the validation method you chose earlier (DNS or email). 

### Step 3: Install certificate into Load Balancer
When your certificate is verified, click on `Add to Load Balancer` to install it into the Load Balancer. Your certificate has been installed, and your site is secure now.
