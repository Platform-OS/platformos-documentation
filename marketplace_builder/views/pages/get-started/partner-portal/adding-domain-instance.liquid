This guide will help you add a new domain to your Instance.

## Requirements
To follow the steps in this tutorial, you should be able to log in to our Partner Portal, and have an Instance you created or have access to.

* [Accessing our Partner Portal](/get-started/setup/accessing-partner-portal)
* [Setting Up a Site on Our Platform](/get-started/setup/setting-up-site)

## Steps

Adding a domain is a two-step process:

1. Find domains associated with an Instance
2. Add new domain

### Step 1: Find domains associated with an Instance
In the menu on the left, click on `Instances`, and select the Instance you would like to add a domain to. You can also [find an Instance through Search](/get-started/partner-portal/finding-instances). The information page of the Instance is displayed.

Click the `DNS & SSL` button. You can see DNS information, and a list of domains associated with the Instance. 

### Step 2: Add new domain
In the field below the domain list, enter the full name of your domain, e.g. `blog.staging-oregon-me.com`. The domain name has to be unique, you can't add a domain associated with another Instance. Click on `add domain`. 

The new domain has been added to the Instance's list of domains. 

To set a domain as the default for emailing, click the `set as default` button. When an email is sent (e.g. password reset or other domain specific notification), links in the email will point to the default domain.
