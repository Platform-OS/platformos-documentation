This guide will help you install the platformOS Marketplace Kit, that allows you to easily deploy your configuration files and assets to our platform, and communicate with the platformOS API.
{% capture content %}
The <a href="/how-platformos-works/platformos-workflow/marketplace-kit">Marketplace Kit</a> provides a wide range of features beyond initializing your codebase, including syncing and deployment, auditing, data export and import, migrations, logging, and a GUI.

## Requirements

To install the Marketplace Kit, you need NPM (Node.js Package Manager). See our tutorials for installing NPM on Mac or Windows:

* [Installing NPM on a Mac](/get-started/installing-npm-mac)
* [Installing NPM on Windows](/get-started/installing-npm-windows)

## Steps

Installing the Marketplace Kit is a two-step process:

<div data-autosteps></div>

### Step 1: Install the Marketplace Kit using NPM

Start your command-line tool (e.g. Terminal on a Mac, or Git Bash on Windows), and enter:

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
npm install -g @platform-os/marketplace-kit
</code></pre>

If your Node.js is installed for all users you might need to use `sudo` to install NPM packages globally:

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
sudo npm install -g @platform-os/marketplace-kit
</code></pre>

You can follow the installation process in your command-line (something similar to this will be displayed during installation):

<pre class="command-line" data-output="1-50" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
/usr/local/bin/marketplace-kit -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/@platform-os/marketplace-kit/marketplace-kit
/usr/local/bin/marketplace-kit-env -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/@platform-os/marketplace-kit/marketplace-kit-env
/usr/local/bin/marketplace-kit-archive -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/@platform-os/marketplace-kit/marketplace-kit-archive
/usr/local/bin/marketplace-kit-env-add -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/@platform-os/marketplace-kit/marketplace-kit-env-add
/usr/local/bin/marketplace-kit-deploy -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/@platform-os/marketplace-kit/marketplace-kit-deploy
/usr/local/bin/marketplace-kit-env-list -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/@platform-os/marketplace-kit/marketplace-kit-env-list
/usr/local/bin/marketplace-kit-push -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/@platform-os/marketplace-kit/marketplace-kit-push
/usr/local/bin/marketplace-kit-sync -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/@platform-os/marketplace-kit/marketplace-kit-sync
/usr/local/bin/marketplace-kit-watch -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/@platform-os/marketplace-kit/marketplace-kit-watch
+ @platform-os/marketplace-kit@1.0.5
added 88 packages in 6.719s
</code></pre>

### Step 2: Test the Marketplace Kit

Use the following command to test the Marketplace Kit:

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
marketplace-kit -V
</code></pre>

If the Marketplace Kit has been installed correctly, running this command displays the version of your Marketplace Kit. If the Marketplace Kit hasn't been installed, running this command gives a `command not found` error.

## Next steps

Congratulations! You have installed the Marketplace Kit. You can now create your codebase.
