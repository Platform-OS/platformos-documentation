## Searching for a page by a content

You can search for a page using its content. This might be helpfull for creating search for FAQ page.
Search will work on rendered page version, so this page can't rely on any dynamic data, ie. `current_user` or url params.
Page needs to be marked as `searchable: true`.


```yaml
---
slug: signup
searchable: true

    }
  ) {
    total_entries
    results {
      slug
      content
    }
  }
}
