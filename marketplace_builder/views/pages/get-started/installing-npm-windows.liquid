This guide will help you install NPM (Node.js Package Manager) on Windows.
You will need NPM to install the PlatformOS Marketplace Kit, that allows you to easily deploy your configuration files and assets to our platform, and communicate with the PlatformOS API.

NPM is distributed with Node.js: when you install Node.js, you automatically get NPM installed on your computer.

## Requirements

This tutorial describes installing Node.js using Git for Windows. We recommend this approach so that you have version control accessible on your computer, and also because you can use the Terminal it provides to run the command-line commands required to install and use the Marketplace Kit.

So for installing Node.js by following this tutorial, you'll need:

* [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win): When the installer asks how you would like to use Git from the command line, select _Run Git and incuded Linux tools from the Windows Command Prompt_, which enables you to do Git and other Linux-like commands from the regular Windows Command Prompt.

## Steps

Installing Node.js on Windows with Git is a two-step process:

1.  Install Node.js from nodejs.org
2.  Access Node.js and NPM

### Step 1: Install Node.js from nodejs.org

Download the latest stable version of the Node.js Windows Installer from the [Node.js Download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Run the installer, and follow the prompts &ndash; you don't have to change any of the default settings during the installation. The installation process finishes with a _"Node.js has been successfully installed."_ message.
You can find Node.js among _All Programs_.

### Step 2: Access Node.js and NPM

You can access Node.js from the installed Node.js command line, or &ndash; as recommended in this tutorial &ndash; from the Git Bash or Windows Command Prompt.

In Git Bash, enter:

* `node -v` to see the version of Node.js installed. The version number of Node.js will be displayed.
* `npm -v` to see the version of NPM installed. The version number of NPM will be displayed.

## Next steps

Congratulations! You have installed NPM on Windows. Now you can install the PlatformOS Marketplace Kit.
