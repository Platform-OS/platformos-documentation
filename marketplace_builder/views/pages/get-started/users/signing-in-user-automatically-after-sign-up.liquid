This guide will help you add automatic sign in to a sign up form, so that a new user will be logged in right after account creation.

## Requirements

This tutorial assumes that you already have a working sign up form, where a user can create a new account.

* [Creating a Sign Up Form](/get-started/users/creating-sign-up-form)

## Steps

Automatic sign in after sign up is a three-step process:

1. Add `callback_actions` key to sign up form
2. Create `user_session_create` GraphQL mutation
3. Create `session_create_form` form

### Step 1: Add `callback_actions` key to Sign up form

In your `sign_up` form configuration add `callback_actions` at the end (order doesn't matter) of the YML definition.

##### `form_configurations/sign_up.liquid`

```liquid
{% raw %}
---
...
callback_actions: "{% execute_query 'user_session_create', email: @form.email, password: @form.password %}"
---
{% endraw %}
```

This code snippet executes the `user_session_create` query, so you have to create it.

### Step 2: Create `user_session_create` GraphQL mutation

This mutation takes two obligatory arguments: `email` and `password` &ndash; both strings.

##### `graph_queries/user_session_create.graphql`

```graphql
mutation user_session_create($email: String!, $password: String!) {
  user_session_create(
    form_configuration_name: "session_create_form" # must match with `name` of your form
    email: $email
    password: $password
  ) {
    email
  }
}
```

This calls the `session_create_form` with the same arguments you received from the `callback_actions`.

### Step 3: Create `session_create_form` form

SessionForm is supported by the server, so you don't need to define anything &ndash; the server will take care of handling user credentials and authenticating the user.

##### `form_configurations/session_create_form`

```yaml
---
name: session_create_form
resource: Session
---
```
