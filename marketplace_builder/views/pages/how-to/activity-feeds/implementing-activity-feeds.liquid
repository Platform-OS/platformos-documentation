This guide will help you create and publish an activity, and then display the activity feed.

You'll follow the sample scenario described in the [Activity Feeds](/how-to/activity-feed/activity-feeds) topic: A user joins a private group by sending a membership request to the group moderator. Later the moderator reviews and accepts the user's request. The user becomes a group member.

This guide shows how to implement the following sample process: After the user clicks the `Join` button, you create the `group-membership` record [`group_id`, `user_id`, `approved_at`]. Group membership is approved by setting the `approved_at` property to the current time.

## Requirements
This is an advanced tutorial. To follow it, you should be familiar with basic PlatformOS concepts, the topics in the Get Started section, and activity feeds.

## Steps
Implementing activity feeds is a three-step process:

1. Create activity
2. Publish activity
3. Display feed
4. Get all feed names

### Step 1: Create activity
Prepare an activity payload (hash).

{% include 'alert/note', content: 'The activity payload can have any structure, but it is recommended to follow the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-activitystreams-core-20170523/">W3C Recommendation for Activity Streams 2.0</a>.' %}

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% capture payload %}
{
  "actor": {
    "type": "Person",
    "id": "{{ user_id }}",
    "name": "Sally Smith"
  },
  "type": "Create",
  "object": {
    "type": "Relationship",
    "id": "{{ model.id }}",
    "name": "GroupMembership"
  },
  "target": {
    "type": "Group",
    "id": "{{ group.id }}"
  }
}
{% endcapture %}
{% assign payload = payload | to_hash %}
{% endraw %}
```

Then use a GraphQL mutation

```graphql
mutation activity_create($payload: ActivityPayload!) {
  activity: activity_create(payload: $payload) {
    uuid
  }
}
```

to add activity to database by executing:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% execute_query 'activity_create', payload: payload, result_name: 'ga' %}
{% endraw %}
```

Under `ga.activity.uuid` you have the UUID of your new activity.

### Step 2: Publish activity

Each Feed has type and ID (both are required).
Each Feed (if does not exist) is created on the fly when an activity publishes to it. You don't have to create it manually - just start publishing to it.

Once the activity is saved you can publish it to some activity feeds.

Create a GraphQL query

```graphql
mutation activity_publish($feed_ids: [ID]!, $uuid: ID!, $feed_type: String!) {
  activity_publish(ids: $feed_ids, uuid: $uuid, feed_type: $feed_type)
}
```

and use it in Liquid like

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% assign user_id = 1 %}
{% assign recipients = "" | split: "|" %}
{% assign recipients = recipients | add_to_array: user_id %}

{% execute_query 'activity_publish', uuid: ga.activity.uuid, feed_ids: recipients, feed_type: 'UserNotifications', result_name: 'gp' %}
{% endraw %}
```

Your activity has been published to `UserNotifications[user_id]` feed.

### Step 3: Display feed
To read the content of your feed, you have to provide `feed_name` and `feed_id`:

```graphql
query activities($type: String!, $id: ID!, $per_page: Int, $page: Int) {
  streams(feed_id: $id, feed_type: $type, per_page: $per_page, page: $page) {
    total_entries
    results {
      id
      uuid
      payload
    }
  }
}
```
```liquid
{% raw %}
{% query_graph 'activities', type: 'UserNotifications', id: user_id, result_name: 'g' %}

total entries: {{ g.streams.total_entries }}

{% for activity in g.streams.results %} {{ activity.payload }} {% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
```

### Step 4: Get all feed names
You can list all created feed types with `ids` by using:

```graphql
query {
  feeds {
    name
    ids
  }
}
```

{% include 'shared/questions_section' %}
