You develop your site (write code) in your **codebase** in your local environment.

## Required directory structure

In order to correctly communicate with the platformOS engine and API, your codebase should be organized into a specific directory structure. The root directory of your project should contain the marketplace_builder directory.

### Recommended directories and files inside the `marketplace_builder` and `modules/<module name>` directories

| Directory/file           | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Learn more                           |
