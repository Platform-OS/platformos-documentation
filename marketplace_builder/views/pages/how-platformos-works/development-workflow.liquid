A **development workflow** is the process you follow during development to save time and minimize errors. It includes stages like setup (scaffolding), development, testing, integration, optimization, and deployment.

## Setup process

The setup process of developing a site using PlatformOS includes three main steps:

1. A Partner creates a new Instance through the Partner Portal. The PlatformOS engine saves the Instance, which &ndash; after authorization &ndash; becomes available for developers to deploy and sync to.
2. Developers create the required directory structure in a local environment.
3. The Marketplace Kit deploys or syncs the codebase to the Instance.

## Version control

We recommend using a version control system. Internally, we use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to host and collaborate on our [git](https://git-scm.com/about) repositories.

You can choose other version control systems, or decide to go without any: all that is required is your codebase and an Instance you can sync/deploy to.

## Development Instances

Development Instances are different copies of the same Instance/codebase used for developing, updating, and testing a site without risking the integrity of the live site.

You can set up different types of Instances (staging/production) through the Partner Portal.

### Local codebase
You develop your site (write code) in your codebase in your local environment.

The framework for the codebase of the Instance is your codebase organized into the required directory structure. To learn more about the directories and files in your PlatformOS codebase, see [PlatformOS Components](/how-platformos-works/platformos-workflow).

### Staging Instance
The staging Instance can be used for testing, presenting the changes to the client for approval, QA (Quality Assurance), or UAT (User Acceptance Testing).

### Production Instance

The production Instance is the live site available to visitors.

Based on the projectâ€™s size, scope, or requirements, stages from the above workflow can be removed, or additional stages can be added. For example, a testing site before staging can be added to separate testing from QA and UAT.
