  title: Keyword Match Type
slug: reference/search/keyword-match-type
---

Search by default tries to match the keyword exactly with the words in the field. When you search for `alan` it will match values `alan`, but also `Mike Alan` and `Mike Alan and Tommy`. You can also define a keyword to match words that start or end with the given phrase.

## Match type

For example, you want to search users whose name starts with `Al`:

```graphql
query search_people {
  people(query: { keyword: "Al", match_type: ENDS_WITH }) {
    results {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Returns users that have `name` starting with `Al*`, e.g. `Alex`, `Alan`, `Alice`.

## Wildcards

Keyword also accepts the wildcards, `?` for single character, and `*` for more. For example:

* `al*r*` will match `alexander`, `alexandra`, but not `alex`
* `al?n` will match `alan`, `alen`, but not `aleen`
