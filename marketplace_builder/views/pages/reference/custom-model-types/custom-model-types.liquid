**Custom Model Types** have multiple use cases:

* Think of them as a custom DB table, which allows you to build highly customized features.
* Use them to group Custom Attributes, and allow the user to provide multiple values for each of them.

For example you can build a table that will store a user's favorite books. Each book has an author, title and a number of pages. These three fields are Custom Attributes. That’s why you can use Custom Model Type to group Custom Attributes.

Now you can build a form that allows users to add multiple books attached to their user profile (using GraphQL).

[Custom Address](/reference/custom-attributes/custom-addresses), for example, is a Custom Model with Custom Attributes attached to it for your convenience. Custom Models you create are used in the same way as our built-in one.

## Defining

Custom Model Type definitions are placed in the `custom_model_types` directory.

The example below shows the BlogPost Custom Model Type `custom_model_types/blog_post.yml`:

<pre><code class="language-yaml">
name: blog_post
custom_attributes:
- name: title
   attribute_type: string
- name: content
   attribute_type: text
</code></pre>
