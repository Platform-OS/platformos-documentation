**Translations** are used for three main purposes:

* Multi-language sites: Manually translate your website and provide static copy in more than one language. You can create a `yml` file that maps the translation key to a value for each language, and then use the `t` filter in Liquid to render proper value, based on the current user’s Locale.

* Date Format: Come up with a common format for a date, then use the `l` filter to render date and time consistently across the platform. This is useful to be able to easily change the way date/time is displayed everywhere, or to customize on a per site basis.

* Flash messages: Define system messages returned by our [API](api-reference/rest-api).
