**Liquid filters** are simple methods that modify the output of numbers, strings, variables and objects. They are placed within an output tag `{% raw %}{{  }}{% endraw %}` and are denoted by a pipe character `|`.

Example:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{{ product.title | upcase }}
{% endraw %}
```

## Liquid filters in PlatformOS

In PlatformOS you can use all standard Liquid filters:

Besides standard Liquid filters, you can also use custom Liquid filters we added.
