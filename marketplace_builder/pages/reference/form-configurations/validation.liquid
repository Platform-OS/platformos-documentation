**Validations** in Form Configurations are used to ensure that fields or attributes correspond to the specified rules, e.g. an `email` field can have a validation that ensures uniqueness (no two user can sign up with the same email address), it has to be a valid email, and it can't be blank.  

## Validation example

```yml
validation:
  presence: true
  unique:
    scope:
      - customizable_type
      - properties: customer_slug
    message: Invitation already sent
```
