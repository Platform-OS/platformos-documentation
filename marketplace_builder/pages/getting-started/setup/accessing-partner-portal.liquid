This guide will help you get access, and log in to our Partner Portal, where you can create, manage and configure Instances (sites), and create and manage the permissions of other Partners (users).

## Steps

Accessing our Partner Portal is a three-step process:

1.  Get invited to our Partner Portal
2.  Set a password
3.  Log in anytime later

### Step 1: Get access to our Partner Portal

Send us an email, or call us to register an account for you on our Partner Portal.

* Email: [to be added]()
* Call: [+1-888-998-3375](tel:+18889983375)

You can also get access to our Partner Portal if a registered Partner creates an account for you.

Once registered, you will get an email invitation. Click on the `Accept invitation` link to activate your account.

Clicking on the link redirects you to a page where you can set your password.

### Step 2: Set a password

Enter a password in the `Password` field.
Repeat your password in the `Password confirmation` field.
Click on the `Set my password` button.

If the two passwords you entered match, you are logged in to our Partner Portal.

### Step 3: Subsequent logins

When you return to the [Partner Portal](http://portal.apps.near-me.com/), click on the `Sign in` button.

On the [Login page](http://portal.apps.near-me.com/users/sign_in) enter your email and password, and click on the `Log in` button.

You are now logged in to our Partner Portal.
